18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,960
Li Susu,

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,840
pick up your cup.

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,750
Do you demons and monsters

21
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,710
also make toasts to heaven and earth?

22
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,030
No.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,400
This cup of wine

24
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,150
is for all the sins in the world.

25
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,000
This one

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,630
is for all the death.

27
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,710
They do worth the toast.

28
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,400
This last cup of bridal wine

29
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,800
is to wish us be together forever.

30
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,120
Lady of Spirituality,

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,030
today is our wedding day.

32
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,430
Do you have any problem with it?

33
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,910
Should I be overjoyed

34
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,400
to stay in this dark and sunless hellhole?

35
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,150
That was negligent of me.

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Mount Changze has towering terrain,

37
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,000
and this Devil Palace is gloomy and dark.

38
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,120
You would certainly
not get used to living here.

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,470
However,

40
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,360
it's easy to fix the problem.

41
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,390
It's time to restore this Devil Palace

42
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,000
to its former appearance.

43
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,750
Return of the Devil God,

44
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,360
in chaos are heaven and earth!

45
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,160
Return of the Devil God,

46
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,750
in chaos are heaven and earth!

47
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,270
When I became the Devil God,

48
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,830
all kinds of karma appeared before my eyes.

49
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,390
I only understood that

50
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,430
good and evil are all caused by karma.

51
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,310
As long as the sins
in the world do not stop,

52
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,680
the Devil God

53
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
will never perish.

54
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,720
Only when the All-in-Distress Way is opened,

55
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,160
the world is in chaos,

56
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,600
and all living beings

57
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,160
can truly return to the same place.

58
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,430
What's that?

59
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,390
It's the Devil Palace! It's in the air!

60
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,680
What?

61
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Hurry up, everybody.

62
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,600
- Yes.
- OK.

63
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
- Yes.
- Let's go.

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,070
Hurry.

65
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,800
My wife,

66
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,510
are you satisfied

67
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,190
with the gift I have given you?

68
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,430
It seems that
the Four Continents and Three Realms

69
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,390
all belong to you now.

70
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,430
Exactly.

71
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,600
when the All-in-Distress Way
completely swallows the world,

72
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,040
the Four Continents and Three Realms
will all belong to me.

73
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,720
And you

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,120
will be my caged bird in this life,

75
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,680
as well as the most interesting decoration
in this Devil Palace.

76
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,040
Indeed, you gave me

77
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,870
a generous gift.

78
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,870
I should give you a big gift in return.

79
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,720
Chongyu Harp.

80
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
Li Susu,

81
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,190
you should know that

82
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,270
with your current spiritual cultivation,

83
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,160
you can't hurt me in the slightest.

84
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Although I can't deal with you,

85
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,950
the Chongyu Harp is a divine instrument

86
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,190
with divine power contained in it.

87
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,160
You want to burn the Chongyu Harp

88
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,750
and release the divine power?

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,600
Yes.

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
It has accompanied me for many years.

91
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,790
When the divine power is exhausted,

92
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,750
it's time to say goodbye.

93
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,600
You are quite generous with this.

94
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,910
I won't need to use it anyway.

95
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,840
The Devil God is in the air.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's that red light?

97
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,360
It's the Incarnation-Abandoning Array.

98
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,320
Susu started
the Incarnation-Abandoning Array.

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,270
The Incarnation-Abandoning Array?

100
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,720
You know it?

101
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,910
Li Susu,

102
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,910
would you rather die

103
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,790
than be my wife?

104
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,910
No,

105
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
if it's possible,

106
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,270
I will bring you to death with me.

107
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,200
Gongye, what should we do?

108
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,670
Li Susu has trapped the Devil God.

109
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,870
It's a great time for us to start the Array.

110
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Susu can't avoid getting hurt.

111
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,840
Today, all sects are
throwing caution to the wind

112
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,720
regardless of cost

113
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,000
in order to eliminate demons,

114
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,480
not to save Li Susu.

115
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,840
Wow,

116
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
bring me to death with you. Great words.

117
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,360
Li Susu,

118
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,870
you should indeed hate me,

119
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,390
but you should hate yourself more.

120
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,670
If you could have awakened earlier

121
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,390
that love to me is nothing but illusory.

122
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,200
How could
the Four Continents and Three Realms

123
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
become like this today?

124
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,840
Yes,

125
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,150
all immortal sects

126
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,240
it was too foolish of me.

127
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
follow my orders!

128
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,750
Get in position!

129
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,360
Yes!

130
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
It was my attempt
to bring you into the light

131
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,000
that brought such heavy darkness
to the Three Realms.

132
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,750
Now I can only make up for it with my life

133
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,840
and try my best to remedy this.

134
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,790
Even if you start
the Incarnation-Abandoning Array,

135
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
you won't kill me.

136
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,720
Whatever you do

137
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
will be in vain.

138
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
Back then, the twelve gods
abandoned their incarnation.

139
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,600
Although they failed to
annihilate the Devil God in one fell swoop,

140
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,120
they severely injured him.

141
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,320
Only then did the God of War
execute the devil

142
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,670
and purify the Three Realms.

143
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,080
I am a disciple of Hengyang Sect

144
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,870
and the daughter of Qu Xuan Zi.

145
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,390
Sacrificing my life to
eliminate the devil is my duty.

146
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,510
Even if I die today,

147
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,240
there will be fellow disciples
who will do the same

148
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,630
until you are killed.

149
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,670
Tantai Jin,

150
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,750
farewell.

151
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,600
Go,

152
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,630
stop them.

153
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,750
Guard the array!

154
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,750
Looks like everything has started.

155
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,670
Come on, hurry up!

156
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,320
Li Susu,

157
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,600
your fellow disciples are here.

158
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,790
Since you are so persistent,

159
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,550
then

160
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,720
I will send you and them to be buried
together for the All-in-Distress Way.

161
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,390
Li Susu,

162
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,550
come here.

163
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,150
Let's witness the destruction of the immortal sects.

164
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,030
Gongye,

165
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,360
all sects are ready.

166
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
Tantai Jin,

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
today

168
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,790
is your last day alive.

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,240
Celestial Punishment Array,

170
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,440
open!

171
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,270
It's the Celestial Punishment.

172
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,000
Looks like your friends from immortal sects

173
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,390
are giving up on you.

174
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,600
As long as the Devil God can be killed,

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,910
I will die without regret.

176
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,150
In this Celestial Punishment,

177
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,480
there are eighty-one thunderbolts.

178
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Even with my Devil God's body,

179
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,510
it is difficult to retreat unscathed.

180
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,200
Abandoning you

181
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,670
in exchange for severely injuring me,

182
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,270
your immortal sects are really cunning.

183
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,120
But you,

184
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,960
you still want to trap me for them

185
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,790
and perish with me.

186
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,670
Being hit by the Celestial Punishment
hurts a lot,

187
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,630
and I don't want to take it.

188
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,910
Since you are bent on dying,

189
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
take it for me.

190
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,320
Tantai Jin!

191
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,200
Li Susu,

192
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,270
goodbye.

193
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,200
These eighty-one thunderbolts

194
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,790
are what you deserve.

195
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,150
Enjoy them,

196
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,240
and regard it as your compensation to me!

197
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,630
What? Tantai Jin escaped!

198
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,000
What should we do, Chief Gongye?

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,630
Yeah.

200
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,390
Tantai Jin!

201
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,270
Chief Gongye,

202
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,110
you really don't care about
details or old feelings.

203
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,200
when you start the array.

204
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,310
You even have the heart

205
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,960
to kill Susu.

206
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,590
As long as we get rid of you,

207
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,750
Susu's death is glorious and meaningful.

208
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,000
Xiaoyao Sword-play,

209
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,720
break!

210
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,000
Who are these kids?

211
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,680
We are disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect!

212
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,000
Immortal Zhaoyou's students!

213
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,200
Gongye Jiwu,

214
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,550
with your power,

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,400
you wouldn't have such abilities.

216
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,480
What have you done?

217
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,720
Everything I did

218
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,070
is just to kill you.

219
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,720
Gongye Jiwu,

220
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,790
you used a forbidden spell

221
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,240
to absorb the power
of your fellow disciples.

222
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,510
Now you have completely changed.

223
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,960
Do you even know who you are now?

224
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
So what?

225
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,400
As long as I can kill you,

226
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
what's wrong with

227
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,030
borrowing a little of their power?

228
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,590
Once he goes into devilry,

229
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,160
he will be completely beyond salvation.

230
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,960
Gongye Jiwu,

231
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,070
stop it.

232
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Gongye Jiwu,

233
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,310
you have gone awry.

234
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,350
That was how you treated me too.

235
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,270
Gongye Jiwu,

236
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,720
you shouldn't be like this,

237
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,070
not tyrannical

238
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,640
not filthy,

239
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,200
or twisted.

240
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,030
I will repay

241
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,920
all my various debts to you.

242
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,310
Gongye Jiwu,

243
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,440
don't fall into evilness anymore.

244
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,790
Jiwu,

245
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,750
don't let evil thoughts control you.

246
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,070
This is the sin

247
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,030
that has accumulated
since the beginning of the world,

248
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,720
and also the reason why you want to destroy
the Four Continents and Three Realms.

249
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,550
I am the Devil God

250
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,960
my life and death are related with you,

251
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,550
my prosperity and decline
are connected with you.

252
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
The evil bone has left my body

253
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,510
and empowered the All-in-Distress Way.

254
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,400
It is only one step away,

255
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,350
just like the great battle
between gods and demons.

256
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,160
Run!

257
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,790
Get out of here!

258
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,790
Li Susu,

259
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,160
hate me from the bottom of your heart.

260
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,750
Tantai Jin,

261
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,110
What are you doing?

262
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,110
The God-slaughtering Crossbow?

263
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,400
How can we give up

264
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
without fighting till the end?

265
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,680
Yeah. Our immortal sects lasted 10,000 years.

266
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,400
Today at the Barren Abyss,

267
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,640
we'd rather die than retreat!

268
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,790
Everyone, sword formation!

269
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,550
We do need to finish this.

270
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,000
Is this 10,000 years ago

271
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,880
[or later?]

272
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,400
[If it's before the war of gods,]

273
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,830
[why is there already the Heaven Lake?]

274
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,000
[If it's after,]

275
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,350
[why are the celestial pillars still here?]

276
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,510
I never knew that

277
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,000
there's such a world in my heart.

278
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,400
That's because

279
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,030
it only exists when you

280
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
look at it.

281
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,160
Mother.

282
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,680
We've been waiting for you for too long…

283
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,510
Too long…

284
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,310
Li Susu.

285
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,590
Come with me.

286
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Where is this place?

287
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,720
I don't know.

288
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,790
But this is

289
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,550
the last place that

290
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,270
hasn't been devoured by All-in-distress Way.

291
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,960
It's going to disappear soon.

292
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,160
Tantai Jin,

293
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,510
the reason why it hasn't been devoured

294
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,440
is because it's the place

295
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,240
farthest from All-in-distress Way.

296
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,000
Farthest from the Devil Palace and killing.

297
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,720
Farthest from the demon realm
where there's bloodshed.

298
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,510
Li Susu,

299
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,750
what are you trying to say?

300
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,920
So,

301
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
in the last moment,

302
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,750
we still have some time to talk.

303
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,350
Li Susu,

304
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,070
you've broke through the Heartless Way

305
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,680
and immortalized.

306
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,880
Now,

307
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,640
you're the only god in this world

308
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,680
and the only one who can kill the Devil God.

309
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,240
You actually have time to talk with me?

310
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,720
So,

311
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,200
this is what you want.

312
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,790
To let me kill you?

313
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You figured it out.

314
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,070
Yeah, Tantai Jin.

315
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,200
So, you don't have to

316
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,000
wear this false husk anymore.

317
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,070
The moment when I broke through Heartless Way,

318
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,200
I saw every corner of this world

319
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,200
and heard every sound between heaven and earth.

320
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,680
I can sense everything in the world,

321
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,590
including your heart.

322
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,110
[You've absorbed the power of the Devil God,]

323
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,270
[but you were never controlled by him.]

324
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,310
[But you still chose to show up in front of me]

325
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,720
as the Devil God.

326
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,880
You forced me to abandon my love

327
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,750
to let me go through nirvana.

328
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,070
You want to watch me

329
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,200
and end all these.

330
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,750
I'm sorry.

331
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,310
This is the only way.

332
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,480
It should also be the ending of the Devil God.

00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,840
I wanted to protect you,

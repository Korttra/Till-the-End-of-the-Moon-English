00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,630
is my great honor.

175
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,480
Your Majesty,

176
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,390
is my big sister faring well?

177
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,960
How should I know?

178
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,480
She…

179
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
She left months ago.

180
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,120
She's a bit willful.

181
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,360
If she offends you,

182
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,390
I beg you to pardon her negligence.

183
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,550
I take all responsibility.

184
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm a little tired.

185
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,670
You shall rest too.

186
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,670
I…

187
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,630
General Ye, this way.

188
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,870
Ye Xiwu,

189
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
where are you?

190
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,120
Mr. Yue, Mrs. Yue,

191
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240
I'll leave her to your care.

192
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,550
Rest assured,

193
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,080
we bear no children,

194
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,030
and she will be our daughter.

195
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,080
Fuya had a miserable childhood.

196
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,550
For safety,

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,390
she needs a new name.

198
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,550
The girl is now yours.

199
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,360
She needs a name to start anew.

200
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,120
We are farmers.

201
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,630
You seem more intelligent.

202
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,000
Maybe you can pick a name.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,270
Yeah, that would be better.

204
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,510
Then, how about Yue Ya?

205
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,390
A reminder of the crescent.

206
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,360
Yue Ya.

207
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,840
-Yue Ya.
-Beautiful.

208
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,720
A good name.

209
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,960
When she smiles,

210
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,870
her eyes squint like a crescent.

211
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,030
Here, fuya.

212
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,790
There.

213
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,510
Fuya.

214
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,630
Do you like this place?

215
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,790
Yes.

216
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,480
You're Yue Ya now.

217
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
The name, Yue Fuya,

218
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,510
must be kept unknown.

219
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,320
Do you know what I mean?

220
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
If you want to learn magic arts,

221
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,120
take this letter to Mount Changze
and ask for Hengyang Sect.

222
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,320
It's Hengyang Sect, remember.

223
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,150
Hengyang Sect, I know.

224
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,870
Hope we'll see each other again.

225
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,270
Fare well.

226
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,840
Sister.

227
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,720
Goodbye.

228
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,320
Jia Pass.

229
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,910
How dare you.

230
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,320
Ye family

231
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,870
runs away overnight,

232
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,320
even before the word arrives.

233
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,000
You think that I'll spare your life?

234
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,790
Guards.

235
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,240
Send a cavalry.

236
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,670
They shall follow me

237
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,000
even into the grave.

238
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,360
Calm down, father.

239
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,320
Jia Pass has fallen.

240
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,910
The urgency now

241
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,790
is to dispatch troops

242
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,670
and reclaim the lost land.

243
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,270
Don't defend them.

244
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,600
Reclaim the lost land?

245
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Ye Xiao has left northward,

246
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,630
and Ye Qingyu has surrendered.

247
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,080
There are no men for the job.

248
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,670
You made an excuse
when I dispatched the troop.

249
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,870
Are you privy to his scheme?

250
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
Please calm down, father.

251
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,510
In just a few months,

252
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,240
Tantai Jin employed talent and
reduced punishment and taxes

253
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,750
to regain peace and prosperity.

254
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,840
It's improper to war with him.

255
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,200
We shall…

256
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,550
Stop your nonsense.

257
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,480
You refuse to war

258
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,910
so you can replace me.

259
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,030
Is that your plan?

260
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,750
No, father.

261
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,600
I serve you with heart and soul.

262
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,910
I will lead an army and reclaim Jia Pass.

263
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,840
As you wish.

264
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,720
I have one more wish, father.

265
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,360
Name it.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
Bingchang's from Ye family.

267
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,120
But she's my wife now.

268
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,910
I beg you to spare her life.

269
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,000
Very well.

270
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,630
Consider your sincerity,

271
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,550
I'll spare her.

272
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,550
Thank you, father.

273
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll not fail you.

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,080
Why don't you leave for the Jing
with Ye Xiao and Ye Qingyu?

275
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,120
Are you staying to spy on us?

276
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes, you're a spy!

277
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,960
The loyalty of Ye family is a joke.

278
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,240
Shame on you.
Surrender without resistance,

279
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,870
I used to accept her food.

280
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,790
How awful.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
Shame on you.

282
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Ye, the traitor.

283
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,750
You don't deserve to marry the prince.

284
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,840
Get out of our country.

285
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,600
Get out of here.

286
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,120
Get out, daughter of Ye, the traitor.

287
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,270
Bah!

288
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,550
Out, out.

289
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,000
Out, out.

290
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,390
I should have come earlier.

291
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,790
What suffering you endured.

292
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,790
I'll allow no more.

293
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,630
But now,

294
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm not sure if I should leave you here.

295
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,790
What do you mean?

296
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,320
Leave me here?

297
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,510
I have no family to rely upon.

298
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,320
Your Highness.

299
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
Hear me out.

300
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,750
Father has promised me

301
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,910
that he will spare you.

302
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,200
Now that the Sheng has no general.

303
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,120
I've asked for myself.

304
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,440
You're going to fight?

305
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,120
Bingchang.

306
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,240
The trip is treacherous and tough.

307
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,440
You're too gentle.

308
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,240
Your Highness.

309
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,510
People are angry.

310
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,110
Even if His Majesty spares me,

311
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,240
they won't do the same

312
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,790
to a member of Ye family.

313
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,160
But that's my least concern.

314
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,000
What troubles me is that

315
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,590
there's no one to tend to you.

316
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,200
If I must die,

317
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,830
I want to die for you.

318
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,110
Your Highness, please take me with you.

319
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,200
I don't want to stay here alone.

320
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,510
Fine.

321
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,880
The war is unpredictable,

322
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,240
but I'll protect you.

323
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,030
I recall the last time

324
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,110
I drank tea
with General Ye in the capital.

325
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,830
How does it come to be like this?

326
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,590
You can never tell.

327
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,310
In a war between two countries,

328
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,480
the people suffer the most.

329
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,590
If I had a choice…

330
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,480
Junior Martial Uncle,

331
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,640
we have lived in two different worlds.

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,590
A matter of this kind

333
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,640
should not trouble you.

334
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,770
You'd better return to Mount Buzhao.

335
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,840
The war is not my concern.

336
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,210
It's you who I'm worried about.

337
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,050
You risk your life on the battlefield.

338
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,600
I'll do the same.

339
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,400
Or if our brothers and sisters ask,

340
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,360
how am I supposed to answer?

341
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,010
Plus,

342
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,450
earthly experience is cultivation, too

343
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,640
I heard people japed

344
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,560
sticking the noses around
is the principle of Xiaoyao Sect.

345
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
I used to doubt that.

346
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,360
Never expect that's true.

347
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,600
Xiao Lin comes in person.

348
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,080
Seems your surrender

349
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
irritates Emperor Sheng.

350
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,010
But I'm expecting

351
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
to meet with Xiao Lin again.

352
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,930
[Jia Pass]
In the old days in the Sheng,

353
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,770
he was the noble prince,

354
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
while I was a hostage prince
under his care.

355
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,880
One may say

356
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,800
I owe him.

357
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,490
Prince Lin is benevolent,

358
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,250
and he's helpful when people need him.

359
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
Helpful when people need him.

360
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,050
That's who he is.

361
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,010
But I'm afraid

362
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,840
I'll be the man who returns evil for good.

363
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,530
The demon

364
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,320
only dines and sleeps for all days.

365
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,840
Capturing the Sheng with them

366
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,800
might take a while.

367
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:04,800
Pian Ran,

368
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,360
find me

369
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,970
some powerful demons.

370
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,490
All great demons within our range

371
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,360
are now answering your call.

372
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,290
There's no more to find.

373
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,840
Jia Pass sits near the Mohe River.

374
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
The river is said to be ominous.

375
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,970
There might be some demons.

376
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,690
Check it out for me.

377
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,120
At the bottom of the Mohe River,

378
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,800
sleeps a demon ten-thousand-year old.

379
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,880
Gather all sorcerers.

380
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,490
Head for the Mohe River.

381
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,840
This is what I think.

382
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,730
If Junior General Ye didn't surrender

383
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,360
and the court had no one to assign,

384
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,450
it won't be Prince Xuancheng
to lead the army.

385
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,640
I also heard that…

386
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,450
Qingyu is known for loyalty.

387
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,210
How so?

388
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,250
What happened?

389
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,160
Emperor Jing was a hostage prince.

390
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,800
Maybe His Majesty thinks

391
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,450
a hostage prince is unworthy of a throne,

392
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,800
thus calling a war.

393
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,120
Senior General Ye is badly injured

394
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,320
while Junior General Ye surrenders.

395
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,010
Our country has passed its prime.

396
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,730
If not for the greed of His Majesty,

397
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,360
we never need to endure this suffering.

398
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,320
Not of our concern.

399
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,210
The business of emperors
has nothing to do with us.

400
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,600
The Jing might just be
a good place to live.

401
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
I heard they garrison along the Mohe River

402
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,160
and treated prisoners and migrants well.

403
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,770
Buddies,

404
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,050
may I ask,

405
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,050
this army of the Jing,

406
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,450
where do they post exactly?

407
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,990
[Bottom of the Mohe River]

408
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,840
We marched day and night.

409
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,640
Now, by the Mohe River,

410
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,600
we can finally take a rest.

411
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
What troubles you?

412
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,640
Something wrong?

413
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,560
The scout just reported

414
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,450
There is a contingent from the Jing

415
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,450
reaching the north bank of the Mohe River.

416
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,880
We just settled a camp

417
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
and start a war right now?

418
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,160
That's the curious part.

419
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,560
The army of the Jing arrived

420
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,450
only to stay put.

421
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,770
But we've recaptured the land for days.

422
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,970
Men and horses are tired.

423
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,930
Not a good time for war.

424
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,600
Wait,

425
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,530
it's a trap.

426
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,080
A trap?

427
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,490
How so?

428
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,530
Haven't figured out.

429
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,600
But it seems to be akin

430
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,600
to what happened in Mount Buzhao.

431
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,800
You've traveled a long journey.

432
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,080
It's time to get prepared.

433
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,050
Today, you must not fail.

434
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,800
Yes, sir.

435
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,400
I need to patrol.

436
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,360
Please show them the way, General Ye.

437
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,880
Let's go.

438
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,560
This is a treacherous deed.

439
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,160
When the formation begins,

440
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,400
please take care of that girl

441
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,400
if you may.

442
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,320
No problem.

443
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,160
Qingyu.

444
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,800
Long time no see.

445
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,010
Big sister.

446
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,800
I've betrayed the Sheng.

447
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,490
I'm ashamed to see you.

448
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,840
I've heard about it along the way.

449
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,770
I believe

450
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,250
you have your own reasons.

451
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,840
But where have you been all these days?

452
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,050
It's a long story.

453
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,930
I saw a few sorcerers in the camp.

454
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,360
What're their businesses?

455
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,010
What is Tantai Jin

456
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,360
up to this time?

457
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,730
You got him there.

458
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,840
His Majesty asked Pian Ran
to awaken a demon

459
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,970
sleeping at the bottom of the Mohe River

460
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,050
for his command.

461
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,710
His men are now preparing for the ritual.

462
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,160
It means

463
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,270
Pian Ran serves him as well.

464
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,920
If Tantai Jin succeeds,

465
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,120
a calamity will ensue.

466
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,440
I must turn things around.

467
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,990
Big sister.

468
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,550
When will the ritual begin?

469
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,230
At the next sunrise.

470
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,400
Your Highness!

471
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,120
Your Highness.

472
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,360
Yes? Any news?

473
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
At the bottom of the Mohe River

474
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,510
lies a sleeping ancient demon.

475
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,950
An army led by Tantai Jin
is already on its way to the Mohe River.

476
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,030
Apparently, they will be making a ritual

477
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,990
to awaken the demon.

478
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,430
An ancient demon, huh?

479
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
Well, I won't have Tantai Jin taming it.

480
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,430
Junior Martial Uncle,

481
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,840
we can't sit back and do nothing.

482
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,430
We have to find a way
to break his formation.

483
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,950
With everything that's going on,

484
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,320
sending in troops would be a bad idea.

485
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,710
We wouldn't want to wake a sleeping dog.

486
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,840
You and I will sneak in there.

487
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
It has got to be fast.

488
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,510
Let's go.

489
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,750
Your Highness, wait.

490
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,480
M-my cup.

491
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,830
Where could His Highness possibly be going

492
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,160
at this hour?

493
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,400
In haste and alone?

494
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,920
Your Majesty,

495
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,070
we've hired some rogue cultivators

496
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,640
who know all about formations
from the southern border.

497
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,790
This is going to work.

498
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,030
Your Majesty,

499
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,070
I've cast a formation.

500
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
The river will split at sunrise.

501
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,960
Walk down the path,
and you should see the demon.

502
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,160
Very well.

503
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,270
It's time.

504
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,510
Start.

505
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,030
This is odd.

506
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,720
I don't sense any demonic energy
coming from this serpent.

507
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,790
It is, however, holding a grudge.

508
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,830
In time,

509
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,030
it will be devoured by a grudge

510
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,960
and turned into a demonic serpent.

511
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,680
Well, that's even better.

512
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,750
What is that?

513
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,200
A clam's shell.

514
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,680
Start the ritual.

515
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,400
Burn the sky and into ashes.

516
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,440
Subdue!

517
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,400
Pian Ran.

518
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,920
Tantai Jin!

519
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,510
The acolytes sent to search for Miss Xiwu
just reported back.

520
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,400
Miss Xiwu is still nowhere to be found.

521
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,800
Keep searching.

522
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,030
I want her back, alive or dead.

523
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,360
Surprise, isn't it?

524
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,950
Bet you didn't see this coming.

525
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,560
You left without saying goodbye.

526
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,750
Now you show your face again

527
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,710
only to work against me.

528
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,710
Oh, well…

529
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,710
So you will remember me your whole life,
won't you?

530
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
I see.

531
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,320
Get her.

532
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,030
Miss Xiwu, are you all right?

533
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,950
That was pretty bold of you,

534
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,640
Miss Xiwu.

535
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,880
Scholar Pang.

536
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:55,990
Your Majesty,

537
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,120
I'll take care of them.

538
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,880
Hang on.

539
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,560
Xiao Lin.

540
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,990
It's been a long time.

541
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,160
Stop all this, Tantai Jin.

542
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,430
Ordering the Firewing Army
to act recklessly

543
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,950
is outrageous and unforgivable.

544
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,030
So what?

545
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,270
And who is to judge, anyway?

546
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,710
I don't see anything wrong
with giving full play to the Army.

547
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,750
Xiao Lin,

548
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,120
I summoned a flock of blood ravens

549
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,230
as a wedding gift
to celebrate your big day.

550
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,470
I hope that you like it.

551
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,030
Little Devil God…

552
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,270
You don't like it?

553
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,600
Why did you do that?

554
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,400
It just so happened that
the people I wanted to get even with

555
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,800
were all in the same place.

556
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,800
Sorry that I ruined your special day.

557
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,840
And I owe it to you.

558
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,470
Xiao Lin,

559
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,800
you have shown me kindness in the past.

560
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,640
For that, I don't want
to make this hard for you.

561
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,600
Leave now…

562
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,840
and I'll let you live.

563
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,990
What? Are you scared?

564
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,920
You know,

565
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,880
I've been learning people skills from you

566
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,560
since I was a kid.

567
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,160
Clearly, you didn't do a good job of that.

568
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,160
Mm.

569
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
In fact, you and I are worlds apart.

570
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,270
But we have one thing in common, though.

571
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,520
Do you know what it is?

572
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,800
Tantai Jin,

573
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,190
what are you trying to say?

574
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,000
You…

575
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,960
are an upright and noble man,

576
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,510
but your brothers aren't fond of you.

577
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,790
They even want to have you replaced.

578
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,160
And me… I'm an aloof and lower-class man.

579
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,480
Wanted dead by my own brothers too.

580
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,280
What a waste of a perfect combination, huh?

581
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,800
You see,

582
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,880
without these unwanted people,

583
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,400
maybe

584
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,880
you and I

585
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,550
could be brothers.

586
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,630
It's such a shame

587
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,230
we are fated…

588
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,510
to be enemies.

589
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,840
I couldn't agree more.

590
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,640
This is why I have to stop you today.

591
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,160
Go ahead.

592
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,000
Kill them all.

593
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,470
The formation has been fixed.

594
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,280
Keep going.

595
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,200
That was him stalling for time.

596
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,200
We've been had.

597
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,310
Oh no!

598
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
They're going to wake the serpent!

599
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,720
This serpent has been dormant
for ten thousand years.

600
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,080
Stuck in a limbo

601
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,600
called Bo're Life.

602
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,810
It means

603
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,410
reliving the past

604
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
in dreams.

605
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,640
Feeling all the feelings you've felt.

606
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,970
And the loop repeats again and again,

607
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,120
leaving you feeling trapped.

608
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,890
So the serpent has had lucid dreams

609
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,720
for ten thousand years?

610
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,450
What happened to its eyes?

611
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,970
There's a fine line between
becoming a demon and a god.

612
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,200
Maybe that's why it's been asleep
for so long.

613
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,520
Waking the sleeping serpent

614
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,640
has triggered a trial meant for it.

615
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,000
We'll find out soon what becomes of it.

616
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,250
Something's off about Tantai Jin.

617
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,160
Is the serpent messing with his head

618
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,520
and trying to lure him
into choosing an evil path?

619
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,560
Guess this is the beginning
of the calamity

620
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,560
setting in 500 years.

621
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,290
How to stop it
from becoming a demonic serpent?

622
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,160
There's only one way.

623
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,040
Enter the serpent's dream and wake it up.

624
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,810
Let me try.

625
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:56,930
Ye Xiwu!

626
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,520
Miss Xiwu!

627
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,600
Can't she wait a bit?

628
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,930
I haven't finished.

629
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,040
Why does Tantai Jin get in, too?

630
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,680
Once in the Bo're Life,

631
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,040
the invaders will lose their memories.

632
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,850
They may turn into small animals.

633
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,040
Or even an everyday tool.

634
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,160
They are in grave danger.

635
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
I'll stop Tantai Jin.

636
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,370
His Majesty just entered.

637
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,680
Is His Majesty going to be okay?

638
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,250
Wise up.

639
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,200
Every man has his own destiny.

640
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,680
I don't think
we should risk our lives for His Majesty.

641
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,080
You have a point,

642
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,640
miss.

643
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,850
Let's be peaceful about this.

644
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,680
Anyway,
no more bursting into the Bo're Life.

645
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,410
Way too many people,

646
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,250
not enough capacity.

647
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,120
His Majesty has entered the Bo're Life.

648
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,520
It may injure His Majesty
if we get into a fight.

649
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,120
We'll sit this one out.

650
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,120
It's three-on-one.

651
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,850
Take down Tantai Jin, guys.

652
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,640
Never born, never died.

653
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
In a state of mind without worries.

654
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,930
Now I let all of you

655
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,370
go through the cycle

656
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,040
of birth,

657
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,250
death,

658
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,410
love,

659
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:49,410
and hate.

660
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,520
Come into my dream.

661
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,720
And be enlightened.

662
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,160
This is

663
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,720
what the Bo're Life is all about.

664
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:11,430
Sang Jiu, Princess of the Unionid Tribe
of the Mohe River

665
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,270
Ming Ye, the God of War
of the Shangqing Realm

666
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:07,490
Long live the God of War!

667
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,080
Long live the God of War!

668
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,290
If I cultivate hard enough,

669
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,770
I will attain godhood one day.

670
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,370
And then, will I be able
to fight the Devil's Army

671
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,640
and protect our lands

672
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,810
alongside the God of War?

673
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,560
Jiu.

674
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,160
Jiu.

675
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,080
Where have you been?

676
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,970
You were nowhere to be found.

677
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,120
Father was worried sick.

678
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,370
Jiwu,

679
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,930
I was away for, like, minutes.

680
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,890
I need you to stay home for a few days.

681
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:56,720
Don't go out.

682
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,000
A war has broken out
between the Gods and the Devils.

683
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,410
When it's all over,

684
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,810
I'll take you out for a breather, alright?

685
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,850
The Mohe River is a small place.

686
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,080
I'm seriously bored to death.

687
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,200
Jiwu.

688
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Alright, that's enough.

689
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,120
You have Father and me

690
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,560
keeping you entertained, no?

691
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,080
It's been days of bloodshed.

692
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,160
And the Devils
haven't crossed the Mohe River?

693
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:31,720
That's right, Father.

694
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,810
I heard Ming Ye, the God of War
is on the front line

695
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,290
with his men defending the river.

696
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,890
It's been eight days,

697
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,000
and they haven't stepped back.

698
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,850
Oh, he's called Ming Ye.

699
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,520
I've heard of this young man.

700
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,370
He was a serpent inhabiting the East Sea.

701
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,640
After years and years of hard cultivation,

702
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,560
he was promoted to the God of War.

703
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,000
And he has dedicated himself
to fight the Devil's Army.

704
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,120
As part of the Water Tribe,

705
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:03,850
we clams have also felt the honor

706
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,640
and been proud.

707
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,490
But Father,

708
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,330
he was a serpent,

709
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,410
whereas we are clams.

710
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,200
What's to be proud of?

711
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,680
Aren't you old enough to know better?

712
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,810
Have you no shame?

713
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,080
You have the nerve to say it.

714
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,250
Ming Ye has divine essence.

715
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:24,970
And you do, too.

716
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,490
He is the God of War.

717
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,520
But you?

718
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,970
You follow Jiwu and me everywhere

719
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,850
and do nothing all day.

720
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,040
You may not be aware,

721
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,970
but it is chaos out there.

722
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,290
A perfect time to cultivate in seclusion.

723
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:40,490
So

724
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,410
how long have you meditated today?

725
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,290
Fine.

726
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:47,970
I'm going to meditate right now.

727
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,810
What's gotten into her lately?

728
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,520
She is secretive,

729
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,600
and so distracted all the time.

730
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,560
Where did she go exactly?

731
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,600
Well, there's a war going on.

732
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
She snuck out to rubber-neck

733
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,600
when we weren't looking.

734
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,250
She did?

735
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,850
Hmm. If you ask me,

736
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,410
she went to see someone in the battle.

737
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,120
Oh, my baby girl is grown up.

738
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,680
If she does ascend to godhood,

739
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,810
I just might swallow my pride

740
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,410
and try to set her up with that man.

741
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,930
We clams haven't been bothering others

742
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,080
for generations.

743
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,410
Thousands of years worth of good deeds

744
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,370
in exchange for

745
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:46,160
a descendant with divine essence.

746
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,490
Regrettably, she's lazy and unmotivated.

747
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,080
Only God knows

748
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,290
when she'll gain immortality.

749
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:55,970
Father,

750
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,560
Jiu is still young.

751
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:58,850
It does no harm for her to have fun.

752
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,040
There are always two sides to everything.

753
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,000
Now that the Devil God has manifested.

754
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,080
With the future of
Four Continents and Three Realms unclear,

755
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,410
the Mohe River

756
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,490
is the safest place she could possibly be.

757
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,120
That's a fair point.

758
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,000
Nothing matters more than her safety.

759
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,040
Deliver a message to the people
of the Water Tribe in the Mohe River.

760
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,930
They must hole up for the next few days.

761
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,450
Do not get involved
in the clash out there.

762
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,370
As you wish.

763
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,850
It's been less than three months
since the Devil God's arrival

764
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,410
and more than half the Four Continents
and Three Realms have been occupied.

765
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,930
This is a critical moment for us.

766
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:40,810
One mistake

767
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,490
and it's all over.

768
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,770
Before Tian Hao, the former God of War,
was taken out,

769
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,640
he made me promise
to defend the Eastern Continent.

770
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:50,810
It's a promise I intend to keep.

771
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,770
The Mohe River will not be lost.

772
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,160
Ming Ye,

773
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,080
my father left both the Eastern Continent

774
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,040
and me to you.

775
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,080
What am I going to do

776
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,600
if something happens to you?

777
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:11,450
Tian Huan,

778
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,330
thanks for healing me.

779
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:16,890
I'm going to go for a walk.

780
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,490

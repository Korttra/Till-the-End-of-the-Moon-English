00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,200
He is the devil fetus.

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,650
He secretly possesses
the God-slaughtering Crossbow.

171
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,440
Even if he's not the Devil God now,

172
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,560
he will some other day.

173
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,090
Even his admission into the sect

174
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,440
and changing of identity

175
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,040
are planned by the Devil God.

176
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,250
Susu,

177
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,400
Chief Cen is telling the truth.

178
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,130
Let me tell everyone another story.

179
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,130
Cang Jiumin,

180
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,040
formerly known as Tantai Jin,

181
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,370
is the king of Jing Kingdom from 500 years ago.

182
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,010
What?

183
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,370
Really? How could this be?

184
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,010
He's even a king?

185
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,370
Is that true?

186
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,130
He was indeed the devil fetus.

187
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,320
He's also the owner of the evil bone
chosen by the Devil God.

188
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,130
But whatever happens,

189
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,770
he will never become the Devil God.

190
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,610
Susu,

191
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,970
how do you know?

192
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,920
Li Susu,

193
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,920
you speak with such confidence.

194
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,560
How dare you jump to conclusions in front of us?

195
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,250
Aren't we all here

196
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
to find out the truth about this?

197
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,770
It won't hurt to listen to her.

198
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,970
Because 500 years ago…

199
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,520
No.

200
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,370
I've personally

201
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,250
extract his evil bone.

202
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,520
What?

203
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,490
Nonsense!

204
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,490
You think extracting the evil bone

205
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,400
is as easy as that?

206
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,970
Yeah.

207
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,680
You have no proof.

208
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,970
Why should we trust you?

209
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,440
Yeah, why should we trust you?

210
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,970
Why should we trust you? Never!

211
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,610
It's okay.

212
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,400
My fellow chiefs,

213
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,130
I know I can't persuade you

214
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,770
without presenting the proof.

215
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,370
I heard Chixiao Sect has an artifact

216
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,280
called the Truth Jade Slip.

217
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,650
It can extract the true memories

218
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,680
of anyone.

219
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,800
I beg you to use this artifact

220
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,890
to tell if I'm telling the truth.

221
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,770
No.

222
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,970
Susu,

223
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,400
don't do this.

224
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,770
This is the only way to tell

225
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,610
what I've been through

226
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,610
to everyone here.

227
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,680
I'd like

228
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,970
to have a try.

229
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,770
Li Susu,

230
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,010
let me see what excuses you can give us.

231
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,560
No.

232
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,320
Susu.

233
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,730
No.

234
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,010
[Susu,]

235
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,320
[we're running out of time.]

236
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,370
[You have to go back now!]

237
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,920
[Then thousand years ago,]

238
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,560
[God of Time left the Light-breaking Array]

239
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,130
[for Xiaoyao Sect chiefs to inherit.]

240
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,770
[I will send you]

241
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,560
[back to Sheng Kingdom 500 years ago.]

242
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,650
[Going back]

243
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,280
[is our only chance.]

244
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,520
[Remember,]

245
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,160
[whatever you see, don't look back.]

246
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,850
[The four continents and three realms
are counting on you.]

247
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,520
[Understand?]

248
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,770
Tantai Jin,

249
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,850
I will definitely

250
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,920
kill you!

251
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,160
[So the truth is really like this.]

252
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,490
[So that's the truth]

253
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,970
[you wouldn't tell me all along.]

254
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,320
[You're most afraid of my death.]

255
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,200
[Yet you wanted me dead the most.]

256
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,770
[That's why you approached me]

257
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,440
[and tried to kill me.]

258
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,160
[Susu,]

259
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,280
[you've done so much for me]

260
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,200
[But I didn't know anything.]

261
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,040
[I didn't know why I'd do that.]

262
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,800
[It's not fatal.]

263
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,680
[I won't die for now.]

264
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,750
[Yingtian Gate]

265
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,610
[The lightning punishment is coming closer.]

266
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,040
[Now,]

267
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,440
[I've taken your evil bone]

268
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,050
[and returned you with my divine essence.]

269
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,090
[You won't be the Devil God anymore.]

270
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,440
What's going on?

271
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,610
I think I saw you guys

272
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,200
in the Truth Jade Slip.

273
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,720
I…

274
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,050
I've destroyed his evil bone

275
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,890
with the might of the lightning punishment.

276
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,570
He won't be the Devil God.

277
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,810
I've severed the fate

278
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,570
of the destined arrival of the Devil God.

279
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,890
This world

280
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,920
is safe now.

281
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,130
Susu,

282
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,810
so this is the whole truth.

283
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,960
You've returned to 500 years ago alone

284
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,920
and did so much for us.

285
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,610
Since I've extracted his evil bone,

286
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,370
this means the prophecy can be reversed.

287
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,890
We can't choose our birth,

288
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,720
but we can choose between good and evil.

289
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,850
Although Tantai Jin is the devil fetus,

290
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,570
he won't be the Devil God anymore.

291
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,650
Now,

292
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,680
the six soul-slaying spikes

293
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
should still be in Tantai Jin's heart.

294
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,000
And there's absolutely

295
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,890
no evil bone inside him.

296
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,960
Go ahead and check

297
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
if you don't believe.

298
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,920
Now,

299
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,330
everyone can be rest assured.

300
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,850
I don't care if he's Tantai Jin or Cang Jiumin,

301
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,440
he is the devil fetus!

302
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,720
Even without the evil bone,

303
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,850
he'll be seduced by demons sooner or later.

304
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,440
We can't afford another massacre.

305
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,760
Leaving him alive

306
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,760
will eventually bring disasters!

307
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,130
Being born as the devil fetus

308
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,000
isn't his fault.

309
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,330
Even if he's really born a devil,

310
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,570
we should give him a chance.

311
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,130
Punishing someone for

312
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,090
something he didn't do

313
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,570
is truly the disgrace of immortal sects!

314
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,240
My son died for no reason at all!

315
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,400
And you're still defending him?

316
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,050
It's Si Ying the she devil who killed Cen Mi.

317
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,370
Cang Jiumin forced himself

318
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,400
to activate the God-slaughtering Crossbow

319
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,090
in order to save civilians.

320
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,850
He's also injured for that.

321
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,240
Cang Jiumin used the God-slaughtering Crossbow

322
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,480
for saving the civilians?

323
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,160
Have we really wronged him?

324
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,530
Is… Is this real?

325
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,960
Thankfully we stopped in time.

326
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,570
Cang Jiumin is the devil fetus.

327
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,650
Are we just letting it go like this?

328
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
This is the rarest chance to stop

329
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,440
the Devil God from resurrecting again!

330
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:03,960
Chief Cen,

331
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,480
please be rest assured.

332
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,610
We will try everything we can

333
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,720
to kill Si Ying and Jing Mie

334
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,130
and do your son justice.

335
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,920
As for Cang Jiumin,

336
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,370
it's not his will to be born as the devil.

337
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,130
Not to mention in the emergency,

338
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,570

339
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,290
There's no doubt about his kindness.

340
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,720
We cultivators must judge clearly.

341
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,530
Everyone,

342
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,650
the divine energy in our Hengyang Sect

343
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
can cleanse the devil energy

344
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,810
and suppress the evil things.

345
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,440
Why don't we put him under house arrest

346
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,570
in our sect

347
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,850
to see if he behaves better?

348
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,330
What do you think of this proposal?

349
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,810
This is a good idea!

350
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,570
Yeah.

351
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,720
With Chief Qu to watching him,
we'll be rest assured.

352
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,960
-Yeah.
-That's right.

353
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,610
Believing in demons

354
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,890
is no different from committing suicide!

355
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,530
I'll put my words in here!

356
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,440
You guys just wait and see!

357
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,720
Get to work!

358
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
No wonder the evil bone didn't react

359
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,530
to our devil energy in Jing capital last time.

360
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,650
The words of that little girl

361
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,650
can only fool the stupid cultivators.

362
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,810
No matter what trick they play,

363
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,330
the evil bone can never be destroyed.

364
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,440
Why did His Highness chose him

365
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
as the devil fetus anyway?

366
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,890
Not only did he offended His Highness,

367
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,960
he also lost the evil bone for a woman.

368
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,090
What do you know?

369
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,810
His Highness has his plans.

370
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,650
But this time,

371
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,850
we almost killed the devil fetus.

372
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,050
We should be more cautious next time.

373
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,680
Report!

374
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,720
My Lords,

375
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,680
we've found it!

376
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,240
After digging 500 years,

377
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
we've finally found it!

378
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
We've found the Devil Palace!

379
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:07,960
See?

380
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,720
His Highness's plan works in mysterious ways.

381
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,290
Devil Palace is where the Devil God was born.

382
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,400
With the palace,

383
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,810
wherever the evil bone is,

384
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
he'll return sooner or later.

[Where can it be hiding?]

391
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,000
Brother Di,

392
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,890
we have something to ask you.

393
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,530
It's about the things in Demon Subduing Peak?

394
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,330
That day, when I heard that Cang Jiumin

395
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,440
had summoned the God-slaughtering Crossbow,

396
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,480
I knew I couldn't hesitate anymore.

397
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,650
They're only short of the Sky-Slashing Sword

398
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,440
before they can revive the Devil God.

399
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,130
I have to tell the truth.

400
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,050
Otherwise,

401
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,240
if I hesitated a little,

402
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,960
it would be too late.

403
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,650
Then you should discuss with us beforehand

404
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,330
to let us be prepared.

405
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
If not for Susu's timely arrival,

406
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,160
Jiumin would've died on the peak.

407
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,200
I knew it's a reckless move,

408
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,570
but do you know how much I hate the Devil God

409
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,890
for sealing me ten thousand years?

410
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,130
Whenever I thought of Chu Huang
who was killed by the Devil God,

411
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,760
I'd lose my sanity out of hatred.

412
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,650
Thanks to this hatred,

413
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,920
I managed to hang on till now.

414
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,290
I'm here

415
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,890
not just to find my daughter whom I'd never met,

416
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,680
but also to help the immortal sects

417
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,050
to stop the Devil God from resurrection.

418
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,530
Please forgive me

419
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,130
if I offended you somewhere.

420
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,650
But after what happened on the peak,

421
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,850
we've given Jiumin

422
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,090
a chance to prove himself.

423
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,890
I won't be against him anymore.

424
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,400
I give you my word.

425

Forget it.

426

We're not here to hold you accountable today.

We actually need a favor from you.

Chief Cen,

429
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,720
we've asked from Lord of Evil

430
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,610
the method of sealing the demonic artifacts.

431
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,290
This God-slaughtering Crossbow is too dangerous.

432
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,090
Now let's seal it with the power of us three.

433
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,610
Nobody can open the box alone.

434
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,480
Chief Cen,

435
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,330

437
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,160
Anything I say would be pointless.

438

Cang Jiumin is a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.

439
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,650
He'll be imprisoned in Hengyang Sect.

440
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,810
For the sake of fairness,

441
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,920
I think it's best

442
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,810

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,410
Heart-guarding Scale.

674
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,200
But the chief gave it

675
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,200
to an outsider disciple
of the royal family of the Sheng

676
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,650
five hundred years ago.

677
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,610
It was a congratulations gift.

678
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,570
And then somehow

679
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,360
it was brought back by Immortal Buxu.

680
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,320
A few cracks have remained on it

681
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,090
which need to be repaired.

682
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,530
We can try the Formation of Melting.

683
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,160
But who should we send to go?

684
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,240
Let Jiumin go.

685
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,760
Dad,

686
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,160
Heart-guarding Scale
has a deep connection with Jiumin.

687
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,530
He is the best person to refine it.

688
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,320
So please let him go.

689
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:02,650
Ok.

690
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,130
We'll take your advice.

691
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,720
Jiumin will refine
the Heart-guarding Scale.

692
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,130
Master,

693
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,610
I don't understand.

694
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,090
Why am I the one with such a big job?

695
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,760
JiuMin,

696
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,720
the Heart-guarding Scale was refined
by Ming Ye back then.

697
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,570
You and Susu were in Bo're Life,

698
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,010
having experienced
the life of Ming Ye as a god.

699
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,090
So you're the best choice

700
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,130
to do this.

701
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:31,800
Yeah.

702
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,490
Me and your master
made the decision together.

703
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,450
We both believe in you.

704
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,570
Jiumin,

705
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,130
I'll leave it to you.

706
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,680
What do I do?

707
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,530
Hold it steady and find a way to melt it.

708
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
Listen carefully.

709
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,130
A voice will tell you how to do it.

710
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,970
But I hear nothing.

711
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,840
Not by your ears,

712
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,880
but by your heart.

713
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,160
Ming Ye.

714
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,650
Look, Hongnai Fruits are there.

715
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,090
Thank you, brother.

716
00:42:58,930 --> 00:42:59,610
Look at it.

717
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,530
I get it.

718
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,760
I've been thinking wrong for so long.

719
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,530
I avoided my nature,

720
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,930
scared of the power I was born with,

721
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,720
and dreaded my origin
and the fate awaiting me.

722
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,280
But it's not about others.

723
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,050
It's all about me.

724
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,160
All of it can be used by my heart.

725
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,880
Today I find the answer.

726
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,650
I know

727
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,650
I am what I am.

728
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,240
JiuMin,

729
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,880
you are a devil fetus,

730
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,050
the seed of the Devil God.

731
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,760
But as long as your heart is
pure and bright,

732
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,720
and you believe in the goodness
of this world,

733
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,360
the Devil God won't awaken.

734
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,530
And the Four Continents and Three Realms

735
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,240
can be finally saved.

736
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,280
I've broken it through.

737
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:30,010
Yes.

738
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,880
You feared to indulge in your powers.

739
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,930
So, you couldn't break through.

740
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,280
What about now?

741
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,410
I'm not afraid anymore.

742
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,680
Jiumin,

743
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,930
Good or evil

744
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,360
has nothing to do
with being an immortal or a devil.

745
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,930
It's up to your heart.

746
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,360
Thank you, master.

747
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,130
Jiumin,

748
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,320
The Mountain Protecting Formation
has been completed.

749
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:54,240
And the Heart-guarding Scale
has a deep connection with you.

750
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,490
So, I'll leave it to you.

751
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,160
Jiumin,

752
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,450
something I wanna ask you.

753
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,880
Susu has the evil bone,

754
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,200
doesn't she?

755
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,360
What happened in Demon Subduing Peak

756
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:13,880
isn't obvious to the casual observer.
But how can Qu not know

757
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,650
what his own daughter's thought is?

758
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,320
He just doesn't wanna disclose it either.

759
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:22,240
If the evil bone could not be removed,

760
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm afraid that Susu will have to

761
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,760
stay in Heaven Lake for her lifetime.

762
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,240
And are you willing to

763
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,360
to be here with her

764
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,050
forever?

765
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,530
Master,

766
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,680
the evil bone was in my body.

767
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,800
Susu suffers instead of me.

768
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,490
Even if I must stay in Hengyang Sect
for the rest of my life,

769
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,650
I won't regret it.

770
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,610
From now on,

771
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,530
I will watch over the evil bone with Susu.

772
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,280
All right. Ok.

773
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,050
Since you're willing to do this too,

774
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,450
just be at ease to stay in Hengyang Sect.

775
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,650
I've got a good disciple finally.

776
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,130
But you take advantage of it.

777
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,800
Somehow,

778
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,930
he becomes a live-in son-in-law
of Hengyang Sect.

779
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,490
It's a great loss of me!

780
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,490
Susu,

781
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,490
we just wanna know

782
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,970
if I survived that time.

783
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,840
I don't think so.

784
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,570
Well…

785
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,200
Susu…

786
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,680
Did I survive?

787
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,490
You seemed to be out on patrol

788
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,570
and eaten by a devil.

789
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,650
Eaten by a devil?

790
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,360
Thank you, Susu.

791
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,240
What about me?

792
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,130
Here he comes. Stop asking.

793
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:57,680
Go, go, go.

794
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,160
-Bye, Susu.
-Bye, Susu.

795
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,200
-Go, go!
-Go, go, go.

796
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,360
-Go, go.
-Go, go, go.

797
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,280
Am I disturbing you?

798
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,800
There is nothing important.

799
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:25,680
Just a little chat.

800
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,880
Talking about the Devil God?

801
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,410
They're afraid of the Devil God, not you.

802
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,490
I know.

803
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,010
But,

804
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,050
only by getting rid of the Demon God,

805
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,410
can they feel at ease.

806
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,880
And only then,

807
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,130
I can be with you in the future.

808
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,680
I'll work with you.

809
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,760
I'll always be there for you.

810
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,450
Take it easy.

811
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,090
Li Susu, Lady of Spirituality,

812
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,490
or Cang Jiumin, a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect,

813
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,880
has plenty of time

814
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,090
to solve these problems later.

815
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,760
There will be ample time for us.

816
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,800
Ok.

817
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,490
Come on,
go with me to Heaven Lake for a walk.

818
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,200
Yes.

819
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,130
So Dad and the others already knew

820
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,320
the evil bone is in me.

821
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,840
So, it's not cleansing my devil energy

822
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,490
with the divine power of Heaven Lake.

823
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,720
This is all for you.

824
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,650
Tantai Jin.

825
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,800
Actually,
it's not too late for you to go away.

826
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,570
Where to go?

827
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,650
The world is so vast.

828
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,760
You can go anywhere.

829
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,410
Stuck in Mount Changze
for the rest of your life,

830
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,200
missing so much good scenery.

831
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,320
What a loss!

832
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,530
Remember you taught me this?

833
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Sketch Spell?

834
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,800
The universe manifests in an inch of land.

835
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,320
The soul follows the mind.

836
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,760
Susu,

837
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,410
even if you stay in the Hengyang Sect
all the time,

838
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,760
I shall stay with you,

839
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,010
enjoying all the mountains and rivers
of this world

840
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,880
and sunsets and mornings.

841
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,970
No scenery is better than

842
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,720
being with you for all eternity.

843
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,200
It's unlikely said by Tantai Jin,

844
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,610
but rather like by Cang Jiumin,

845
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,570
a disciple of Uncle Zhaoyou.

846
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,410
In fact,

847
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,360
I've been looking for you for 500 years.

848
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,800
Every day for these 500 years,

849
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:27,840
I've been thinking

850
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,360
that if god

851
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,280
has mercy on me

852
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,160
and gives me a chance to meet you again,

853
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,050
then what I can do to make you happy.

854
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,240
So,

855
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:50,410
I am Tantai,

856
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,970
and I am also Cang Jiumin.

857
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,530
Anything that makes you happy

858
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,360
will be done by me.

859
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,130
Tantai Jin,

860
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,650
what have you learned in Xiaoyao Sect?

861
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:07,760
I learned a lot.

862
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,970
You have said it.

863
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,720
So don't regret it.

864
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,490
I won't.

866
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,320
betray my words,

867
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,970
Heaven and Earth will slay me.

868
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,240

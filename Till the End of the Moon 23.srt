[Episode 23]

17
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,920
Ye Qingyu.

18
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,710
You're awake.

19
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,350
You were drunk last night.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,560
Do you have a headache?

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,280
I was being impulsive
after drinking last night.

22
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,310
Please don't take it to heart.

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,310
I can tell the difference.

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,840
That's good then.

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,590
Ye Qingyu, I…

26
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,750
You're here to ask me
about the antidote, right?

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,560
You can be frank with me.

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,560
I can't stay here any longer.

29
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,000
Give me the antidote.

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
And I'll leave the capital by myself.

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Why? Is it because of me?

32
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,310
I really don't know
if I should feel honored

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,870
or unfortunate.

34
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,080
Ye Qingyu, it's impossible between us.

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,150
What do I have to do

36
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,430
for you to give me the antidote?

37
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,240
There is no antidote.

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,590
What?

39
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,120
His Majesty told me

40
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,120
that the pill he forced you to swallow

41
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,800
was just a regular tonic pill.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,030
Tantai Jin!

43
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,960
So, you're free.

44
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,750
Tantai Jin said
he gave the antidote to you.

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,280
I can never leave your side

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,150
as long as you use
that excuse to keep me around.

47
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,870
Why did you tell me the truth?

48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
You're a woman of your word.

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,560
And I enjoyed momentary pleasure with you.

50
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,190
I dare not expect God

51
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,710
to favor me again.

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,030
Pian Ran, encountering you
was the most fortunate event

53
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,750
that had happened to me.

54
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,360
What if I feel like
staying in the capital again?

55
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,040
It's okay. You can go wherever you want.

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,510
If you don't wish to see me,

57
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,560
I can write to His Majesty
and leave the capital myself.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,430
Ye Qingyu,

59
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,040
are you truly a fool?
Or are you pretending to be one?

60
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,870
Forget it.
I can't bother to explain it to you.

61
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,560
Anyway, I'm free now.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
I can go wherever I want.

63
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,950
Now, I feel like
staying in the capital again.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,270
Pian Ran.

65
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,630
So,

66
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,750
we can spend time with each other again,

67
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,040
right?

68
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,310
I guess. It depends on your performance.

69
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,750
Xiwu,

70
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,070
have you two reconciled with each other?

71
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,920
There's nothing to reconcile about.

72
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,190
There are no overnight grudges
between husband and wife.

73
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,830
Buttercup,

74
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,560
you must tell me if you feel troubled.

75
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,750
Don't hold it in and suffer alone.

76
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm perfectly fine.

77
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
How can that be?

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Tantai Jin is the emperor now.

79
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,120
And our family has fallen from grace.

80
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,480
You may inevitably be subjected

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,720
to humiliation in front of him.

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,190
What humiliation?

83
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,750
I made him sleep on the floor last night.

84
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,430
Xiwu,

85
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,750
you're excellent at taming your husband.

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,950
Speaking of which,
Bingchang hasn't returned home yet

87
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
after she arrived in the capital.

88
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
Now, Bingchang is

89
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,190
the noble Madam Xuancheng.

90
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,480
Tantai Jin lets her live in the palace.

91
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,160
I think he's afraid that Xiao Lin
may snatch her away.

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,430
It's always safer to hide in the palace.

93
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,950
When she's in the Palace of Jing,

94
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,270
Xiao Lin will have to hold back.

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,870
They won't ignore her.

96
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,720
Has Bingchang
suffered any grievances then?

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,310
Don't worry, Grandma.

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Tantai Jin isn't that kind of person.

99
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,560
If you're still worried,

100
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,480
I'll visit her after dinner

101
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,800
and ask her if she's willing to move back.

102
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Good.

103
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,430
Come on, eat up.

104
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
That's the gist of it.

105
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,870
Bingchang, you must have suffered
for the past few days.

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,630
I'll apologize to you
on Tantai Jin's behalf.

107
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,560
There's no need to say that.

108
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,560
How could I make
the emperor apologize to me?

109
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm happy for you

110
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,070
that you two have
reconciled with each other.

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,800
That's typical of Tantai Jin.

112
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,040
He's so capricious.

113
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,000
Just don't take it to heart.

114
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,120
If you can't get used to
living in the palace,

115
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,630
I can speak with Tantai Jin

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,070
and tell him to let you leave.

117
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,390
You can go home and
live with Grandma and Dad.

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,390
No need.

119
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,800
I mean, His Majesty must have his reasons

120
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,040
to let me stay in the palace.

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,560
Besides, I've already gotten used to it.

122
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,720
I shouldn't go home

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,430
and disturb Grandma and Dad.

124
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,510
But…

125
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,190
Xiwu, we are both married women.

126
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,360
How can we keep
living in our parents' home?

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,630
It's good for you that

128
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,430
you can stay by His Majesty's side.

129
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,430
But me?

130
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,680
Prince Lin is still missing.

131
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
If I live at home,

132
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,270
I'll look like a divorced woman instead.

133
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,870
Our neighbors will criticize us.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,720
It's better if I live in the palace.

135
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,040
All right.

136
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
But Grandma and Dad do miss you very much.

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,950
Please visit them when you're free.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,040
All right. Thanks for your concern.

139
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,120
Then I'll head back first.

140

Your Majesty.

150
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,910
You may speak over there.

151
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,270
I don't know what I have done wrong

152
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,510
to make you dislike me.

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,960
You have done nothing wrong.
Once I capture Xiao Lin,

154
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll let you two reunite.

155
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,360
Your Majesty, do you have to
capture Prince Xuancheng?

156
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,600
Why did you think I allowed you

157
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,030
to stay here in the first place?

158
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,200
Your Majesty,

159

I have something to discuss with you.

160
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,670
The rations I borrowed two days ago

161
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,000
will run out in another two days.

162
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,510
We're out of medicine and bandages too.

163
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,240
What should we do?

164
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,360
Is there any nearby county which
we haven't borrowed rations from?

165
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
There's none.

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,720
Try again then.

167
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,870
Your Highness, you're now a rebel.

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
We're all wanted criminals.

169
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,550
Forget about borrowing rations.

170
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,440
They have already done us one last favor

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,080
by not reporting us
to the local authorities.

172
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,270
Junior Martial Uncle,
what are our odds of winning

173
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,670
if we keep this up?

174
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,630
Well, you see…

175
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,150
We have no chance of winning, right?

176
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,910
There's nothing we can do about it.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,670
Do you still remember you, me, and Qingyu

178
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,600
used to discuss
state affairs in the capital?

179
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,240
Common folks always suffer

180
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
no matter how the state does.

181
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,080
It's always been like this.

182
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,320
I've engaged the people of Jing in battle
on numerous occasions.

183
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,120
Although Jing Kingdom is our enemy,

184
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,390
their soldiers and people

185
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,000
are made of flesh and blood too.

186
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,150
Qingyu was right.

187
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,480
To common folks, war is detrimental
no matter if it's won or lost.

188
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,150
Now, Tantai Jin fights for peace.

189
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,120
People want him to unite the world.

190
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,030
Maybe I should lead
our remaining people southward

191
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,550
and leave this place.

192
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,630
How could you harbor such thoughts?

193
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,200
Your Highness!

194
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,910
Your Highness.

195
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,200
The spy we planted in the Capital of Jing

196
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,390
sent us a secret letter.

197
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,550
It's for you.

198
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,440
It's Bingchang's handwriting.

199
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,510
No wonder Tantai Jin
allowed her to write to you.

200
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,960
The content of the letter
praises his benevolence.

201
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,150
Looks like Tantai Jin

202
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,120
is still bent on making you surrender.

203
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,960
Something's not right.

204
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,080

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,500

Your Majesty.

210
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,100
Disaster relief involves many aspects.

You're from Sheng Kingdom.

212
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,690
I feel most reassured to let you

help the refugees to settle down.

214

Now, the world is united.

216
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,170
I desire for

217
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,050
the people of Sheng Kingdom to settle down

218
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,140
and recoup their losses

219

more than anyone else.

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,930
And I appreciate your kindness
more than anyone else.

221
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,050
Today's the Qixi Festival.

222
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,690
I heard that the night of Qixi
in the Capital of Jing is the liveliest.

223
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,930
Why don't you

224
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,460
go for a stroll with Pian Ran?

225

Go ahead.

Let's go.

229
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,650
Now, Sheng and Jing are united.
The state is in peace.

230
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,260
We can finally have a proper festival.

231
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,100
That's right.

232
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,220
You accomplished a good deed.

233
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,260
I just did what a ruler should do.

234
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,740
Are you all right?

235
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,890
I'm fine.

236
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,050
It's crowded here.

237
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,460
Today's the last day of
the Water Festival.

238
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,410
And it's also the Qixi Festival.

239
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,860
The townsfolk are all out on the streets.

240
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,140
The liveliest day of the year

241
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,460
is today.

242
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,620
Tantai Jin,

243
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,620
why are they all wearing masks?

244
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,290
It's for the seven-day-long deity parade
during the Water Festival.

245
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,980
It is said that it would
help exorcise demons.

No wonder.

Since the wizard pointed at him,

302
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,370
that meant he had been chosen
as the Devil God.

303

You heard of the War of the Titans
that happened 10,000 years ago, right?

Wouldn't it be a waste
if we were to get drunk?

369
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,610

What were you thinking?

371
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,940
I…

372
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,530
The moon is clear and bright tonight.

373
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,850
It's perfect for fox spirits
to cultivate their powers.

374
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,260
I actually forgot about it.

375
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,020
If I don't absorb enough moon essence
in time,

376
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,260
even spirits like us will grow old.

377
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,420
By then, you'll be scared to death

378
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,180
when my hair turns gray,

379
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,370
and my face is full of wrinkles.

380
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,370
Even so,

381
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,660
you're still the cutest to me.

382
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,770
But I'm a mortal.

383
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,850
At most, I can live a hundred years.

384
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,330
I'm afraid I have no chance
to witness that moment.

385
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,290
Actually, there's a simple solution to it.

386
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,500
There's a legend among fox spirits.

387
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,700
Legend has it that if you're married
to your true love,

388
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,260
with a bite on the arm and
a drop of blood as a vow,

389
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,940
even if one of them dies,

390
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,740
their soul will not
head to the underworld.

391
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,020
This way, they can be together forever.

392
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,420
Really?

393
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,290
I haven't tried it before.
How would I know?

394
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,810
Even if that day does come,

395
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,180
I won't give it a try.

396
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,980
I'll drink a lot of wine,
find another man,

397
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,900
and forget about you completely.

398
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,500
If so, I can rest at ease.

Do you guys want to buy some candy?

413
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,290
Little girl,

414
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,330
were you separated from your parents?

415
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,850
You're so young.

416
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,770
Why are you selling things alone here?

417
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,660
Stop right there.

418
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,460
What are you doing?

419
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,570
I'll buy the whole basket.

420
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,180
Where are your parents?

421
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,740
They're dead.

422
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,260
Come.

423
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,290
Take this pouch

424
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,700
and go to the new orphanage
located at the East Palace Gate.

425
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,700
Find the manager there.

426
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,530
He'll find you a new place to live.

427
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,290
Thank you, mister.

428
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,610
Go now.

429
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,260
Why did you buy so much candy?

430
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,260
To eat.

431
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,330
Your Majesty!

432
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,570
Let's go.

433
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,530
Your Highness,

434
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,900
Tantai Jin hasn't returned
to the palace yet.

435
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,770
Okay. Let's split up and execute the plan.

436
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,900
Your Majesty!

437
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,130
Over there!

438
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,370
Your Majesty!

439
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,460
They almost found us.

440
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,050
Why were they chasing you?

441
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,660
I guess they want to see me.

442
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,610
See you for what?

443
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,370
I heard that Tantai Wuji
was deserted by his people.

444
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,570
Tantai Minglang was tyrannical

445
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,660
and was killed by a swarm of mice.

446
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,290
The day I entered the capital,
countless mice fled, and the tyrant died.

447
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,290
The news spread and people regarded it
as an auspicious sign.

448
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,530
Later, they even said
that I was a god sent from above.

449
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,130
See, everyone does love you.

450
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,810
They're just following the herd.

451
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Now, they see me as a god.

452
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,700
But they might see me as a devil later.

453
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,090
Why are you belittling yourself like this?

454
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,530
You deserve to be liked by people

455
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,330
after accomplishing a good deed.

456
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,940
I think you just lack compliments.

457
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,810
You'll get used to it
after being praised by us

458
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,180
for a few more years.

459
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,660
[No, I'm afraid
his time is running short.]

460
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,740
[I must destroy the evil bone]

461
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,770
[within one year.]

462
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,090
I don't care

463
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,460
whether people like me or not.

464
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,330
It's enough as long as you like me.

465
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,740
You should have this.

466
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,460
I don't like it.

467
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,020
If so, why did you buy so many of them?

468
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,940
Do you still remember
the previous New Year's Eve?

469
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,660
That was my first time
hanging out on the street.

470
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,290
You bought me a new coat.

471
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,980
It was snowing that day.

472
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,770
And it got dark pretty soon.

473
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,850
On our way home,

474
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,220
we met a woman selling firecrackers.

475
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,610
Ma'am,

476
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,530
please sell all your firecrackers to me.

477
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,740
Miss,

478
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,770
my firecrackers are homemade.

479
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,020
They're not very nice.

480
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,740
It's fine. I like such firecrackers.

481
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,500
Miss, well…

482
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,980
And this. Take it.

483
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,570
Happy Chinese New Year, ma'am.

484
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:43,940
But Miss…

485
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,020
Back then, I couldn't understand

486
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,260
why you did so.

487
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,020
But now, I can understand why.

488
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,700
Understand what?

489
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:07,350
♪Rather than wake from this slumber
 I'd prefer the dream to last forever♪

490
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,050
I understand how tough it is for the sick.

491
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,740
I understand how miserable it is
for the poor.

492
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,370
I understand sympathy.

493
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,610
And I understand the desire to do good.

494
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,290
I can feel their pain and hardships.

495
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,530
Now,

496
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,850
I just want to do everything I can
to help more people.

497
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,260
For some reason,

498
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,180
ever since I came back from Mohe River

499
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,850
and had you by my side,

500
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,130
it seemed like

501
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,090
I was able to feel more and more emotions.

502
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,460
Suddenly, I was able to appreciate

503
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,850
how beautiful this world was.

504
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,500
[What will happen if I tell him]

505
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:06,900
[about the evil bone?]

506
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,250
[Maybe]

507
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,650
[he won't turn into the Devil God
on his initiative]

508
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,690
[once he knows the truth.]

509
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,530
[And, I'll be able to be with him forever]

510
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,130
[and protect him.]

511
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,570
[I won't need to turn my
Soul-slaying Teardrop into spikes]

512
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,900
[and stab his heart with them.]

513
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,170
What's wrong?

514
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,860
Tantai Jin,

515
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,170
I think

516
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,530
there's something

517
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,530
you have to know.

518
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,500
What is it?

519
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,050
-Your Majesty!
-I…

520
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,500
Your Majesty!

521
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:13,980
There you are!

522
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,530
How could you leave the palace
without telling me?

523
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,210
Even if you forbade me from following you,

524
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,570
at least you should notify me.

525
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,460
Miss Xiwu, you're also here.

526
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,730
I guess I'll make a move.

527
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,610
Never mind.

528
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,730
It's getting late.

529
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,650
I'll return with you.

530
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,820
[Forget it.]

531
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,170
[I'll find another chance to tell him.]

532
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,460
Your Majesty.

533
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,610
I have something to discuss with you.

534
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,250
Will you let me stay by your side

535
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,730
if I assist you in capturing
Prince Xuancheng?

536
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,650
[The city gates are open
on the night of the Water Festival.]

537
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,170
[Tonight's the only night
Xiao Lin can enter the city.]

538
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,090
[If he succeeds,
my safety will be guaranteed.]

539
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,420
[If he fails,]

540
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,530
[this will be my gift to Tantai Jin.]

541
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,300
[Either way, it's my win.]

542
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,460
[Seems like the show's about to begin.]

543
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,610
No need to hide. Show yourself.

544
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,980
Miss Bingchang, hush. It's me.

545
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,250
Scholar Pang?

546
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,690
We're running out of time. Let's go!

547
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,690
[If Pang Yizhi is here,]

548
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,090
[that means the plan worked.]

549
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,020
[Xiao Lin is definitely here.]

550
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,570
Xiao Lin.

551
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,340
Now, you're the only survivor
of Sheng Kingdom.

552
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,380
You should cherish your life.

553
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,340
My life means nothing compared to
the calamity our kingdom is facing.

554
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,690
The calamity your kingdom is facing?
Seems more like personal affairs to me.

555
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,090
Miss Bingchang, what's wrong?

556
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,860
[The final winner is still unknown.]

557
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
[I can't leave yet.]

558
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,730
Scholar Pang, I can't walk.

559
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,690
You guys can go on without me.

560
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,570
His Highness entrusted you to me.

561
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,610
How could I leave you behind?

562
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:27,650
Zhong Tai!

563
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,820
Scholar Pang.

564
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,340
Escort Miss Bingchang out of here.

565
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,380
Yes, sir.

566
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,210
Someone! Help!

567
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,170
Stop!

568
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,170
What happened?

569
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,460
There are assassins in the palace!

570
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,820
You must be careful!

571
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,340
Someone's trying to
assassinate Tantai Jin?

572
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,420
Let them go.

573
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,500
Are you going to kill me?

574
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,460
Xiao Lin.

575
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
The conflict between the two kingdoms
just ended not long ago.

576
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,780
The world is gradually regaining peace.

577
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,940
If you kill me today,

578
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,940
the two kingdoms will
descend into chaos again.

579
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,780
Countless people will die.

580
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,130
You know that

581
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,340
better than anyone.

582
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,340
That's why you won't kill me.

583
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,690
Why are you here today?

584
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,820
I want you to pull back your troops
and end the war.

585
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,170
A fair request.

586
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,780
But it's a shame.

587
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,570
Today,

588
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,170
you don't get to bargain with me.

589
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,530
You knew I was going to
assassinate you tonight?

590
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,860
Every inch of land is my territory now.

591
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,340
Now, my eyes and ears are everywhere.

592
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,170
My informant will tell me everything,
including when you made your plan

593
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,780
and when you will set off.

594
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,340
Today, Prince Xuancheng,
you came here uninvited.

595
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,340
It would be rude of me
not to give you a warm welcome.

596
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,460
I admit defeat.

597
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,530
Kneel.

598
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:55,980
Xiao Lin.

599
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,460
Is this all that's left of

600
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,900
the Dragon Guards?

601
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,940
Where are your two trusted followers?

602
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,340
Madam Xuancheng,

603
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,380
where are you going
in the middle of the night?

604
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,730
[Seems like Xiao Lin failed.]

605
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,210
How dare you kidnap me?

606
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,900
Chief Pian, they wanted to kidnap me.

607
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,690
Save me!

608
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,900
You guys heard that, right?

609
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,940
What a bunch of foolish men.

610
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,650
You all can't even figure this out?

611
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,940
Tantai Jin!

612
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:47,940
Tantai Jin!

613
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,300
Why are you here at such a late hour?

614
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,210
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

615
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,090
Don't worry. I'm fine.

616
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,250
I was terrified.

617
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,860
Look at you. Your hands are freezing.

618
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,050
Do you feel better now?

619
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,020
Xiao Lin?

620
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,530
[Xiao Lin actually
tried to assassinate him?]

621
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,860
[What should I do?]

622
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,250
It's been a long time, Miss Xiwu.

623
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,650
Well…

624
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,460
You'd better not ask me

625
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,020
to show him mercy at this moment.

626
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,210
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Xiwu.

627
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,130
I was aware of the consequences.

628
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,730
Reporting in!

629
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:47,170
Reporting in!

630
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,130
Chief Pian Ran

631
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,250
has intercepted the rebels
who kidnapped Madam Xuancheng.

632
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,650
Your Majesty, don't worry.
Madam Xuancheng is fine.

633
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,020
Good. Tell Pian Ran to bring her here.

634
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,170
I need to ask her something.

635
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

636
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,570
Run!

637
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,130
What?

638
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:14,090
Don't tell me you want me to help you up?

639
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,130
I wasn't on their side.

640
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,130
Please clarify the truth
in front of His Majesty on my behalf.

641
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:25,900
Is that so?

642
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,250
Why do you possess it?

643
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,530
What do you mean?

644
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:42,900
Speak!

645
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,050
Why do you possess this love thread?

646
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,860
I don't know!

647
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,210
Let go of me!

648
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,730
I'm a distinguished guest of His Majesty.

649
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,500
I'm going to ask you one last time.

650
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,500
Where did you get that love thread?

651
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,380
Do you really think I'm as stupid as them?

652
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,460
You think

653
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,500
I can't do anything to you
if you don't talk?

654
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,780
Let go.

655
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,380
Pian Ran, calm down.

656
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:25,380
Don't do anything silly.

657
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,050
Qingyu, she's trying to kill me.

658
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,730
Qingyu.

659
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,780
No matter what my sister has done,

660
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,300
I'll apologize to you on her behalf.

661
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,090
Let's straighten things out first.

662
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,020
I've got nothing
to straighten out with you.

663
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,980
Out of my way!

664
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,250
Get lost.

665
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,780
Get lost!

666
00:47:59,050 --> 00:47:59,650
Pian Ran.

667
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,210
You mentioned something
about a love thread just now.

668
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,020
What exactly is going on?

669
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:08,780
It's none of your business.

670
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,980
How could that be?

671
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,250
Chief, His Majesty has ordered you
to bring Madam Xuancheng to the main hall.

672
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,940
Sir, I failed to complete my mission.

673
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:32,380
How come?

674
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,020
Miss Bingchang claimed that
we kidnapped her.

675
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,300
She was unwilling to leave with us.

676
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,420
Why would Xiao Lin
fall for someone like her?

677
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:41,860
Scholar Pang,

678
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,460
what should we do now?

679
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,860
Leave the capital in small groups

680
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,610
as per His Highness's instruction.

681
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,170
After that, join up with
Chen Xian's main force.

682
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:51,570
Yes, sir.

683
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,940
Let's go.

684
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,900
Prince Xuancheng,

685
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,690
it might be too sentimental for you

686
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,820
to meet your wife in a foreign land.

687
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,570
Why don't you wait behind the hall
for a while?

688
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,380
Please.

689
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:13,860
What's the matter?

690
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,250
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

691
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,690
Were you hurt?

692
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,090
Out of all the things to do,

693
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,650
why did you put your neck into the noose?

694
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,610
Reporting in!

695
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:31,900
Reporting in!

696
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,170
Chief Pian Ran, General Ye,

697
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,570
and Madam Xuancheng are here
to seek an audience.

698
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,690
Let them in.

699
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:37,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

700
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,050
[In the end, Bingchang still
couldn't make it out.]

701
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,210
Madam Xuancheng contributed the most

702
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,690
to the assassins' capture tonight.

703
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,340
She deserves the highest award.

704
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

705
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,340
I'm honored to resolve
your troubles for you.

706
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,050
I…

707
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,380
dare not take credit for it.

708
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,820
What does that mean?

709
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,860
What has Bingchang
got to do with this operation?

710
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,860
You sent Xiao Lin a letter
with encrypted messages

711
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,570
to make him believe that
your life was in danger.

712
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,820
You asked for his help urgently
with the letter you wrote.

713
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,820
A chivalrous man like Xiao Lin
would definitely

714
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,530
come to your rescue personally.

715
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,980
This is a devious scheme that
takes advantage of human nature.

716
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,650
You have outdone most of my advisers.

717
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,340
I'm flattered, Your Majesty.

718
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,300
But I'm curious about something.

719
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,980
What if Xiao Lin succeeded

720
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,500
in assassinating me tonight?

721
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,570
Would you swim with the current

722
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,860
and leave together with him?

723
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Your Majesty, please give us
your wise judgment.

724
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,130
I had cut off all ties with Xiao Lin

725
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,210
ever since I came back from Sheng Kingdom.

726
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,980
Bingchang, you…

727
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:17,000

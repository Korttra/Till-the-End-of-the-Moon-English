hiding behind him.

For so many years,

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,080

92
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,560

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,530
I'm finally back at your side.

104
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,120
Auntie Lan'an.

105
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,730
I failed the Princess's trust.

106
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
Your Highness, I failed you.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,490
But I didn't lie to you.

108
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,290
I promised you,

109
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,850
and now I'm back.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Why did you leave back then?

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,240
And why are you back today?

112
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,930
Back then, Emperor Jing
left us alone in the palace.

113
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,370
But without anyone to rely on
in the dangerous palace,

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,880
it was hard to survive.

115
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,730
I had to take the chance
when they dismissed the maids

116
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,370
to escape from the palace.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,610
I wanted to return to the Yiyue tribe

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,810
and have the tribe's help to rescue you.

119
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,440
But there was an accident in the tribe,

120
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,880
and the old Chief was dead.

121
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,240
The current Chief didn't want to
offend Jing Kingdom,

122
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,640
so he didn't want to interfere.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
And you stayed there.

124
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,610
Your Highness,

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,490
I don't dare to disappoint the Princess.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,730
I lived in disgrace,
trying to gain a foothold.

127
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,760
I even had to marry the Chief.

128
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,560
It took me 20 years

129
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,320
to become the High Priestess.

130
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,610
Now the whole tribe follows my orders.

131
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,850
Finally, I could bring Moonshadow Guards
from thousands of miles away

132
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,440
to find you, Your Highness.

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,050
I'm back to save you, Your Highness.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,930
Stand up to talk.

135
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,560
Thank you.

136
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,530
Your Highness,

137
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,240
you've grown up.

138
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,080
Auntie,

139
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,120
Auntie, I don't remember

140
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,410
you having Yiyue's talents.

141
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,240
Who sent the nightingale?

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Nian Baiyu,

143
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,930
come out.

144
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,000
Your Highness,

145
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,680
he is the head of the Moonshadow Guards.

146
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,000
The old Chief once saved his father,

147
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,970
so the Nians

148
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,760
will absolutely be loyal to you.

149
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,010
You have that talent?

150
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:34,840
Yes.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,560
People from the Yiyue tribe

152
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,050
can not only control birds

153
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,290
but also mentally engage
with their exclusive birds.

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,960
This nightingale is my exclusive bird.

155
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,440
Your Highness,

156
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,200
after what happened in Xuancheng Palace,

157
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm afraid that Emperor Sheng
has been suspecting you.

158
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,290
These days, Mr. Nian and I

159
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,810
have dealt with a few waves of assassins

160
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,290
sent from the palace.

161
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,290
Surely they will not give up easily.

162
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,050
I've brought a team of Moonshadow Guards

163
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,770
and got a big boat ready at the ferry.

164
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,410
They are enough to escort you

165
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,930
and send you back to
the Yiyue tribe safely.

166
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
I never said I wanted to go back.

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Are you willing to stay
in the Sheng Kingdom,

168
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
and be the hostage prince?

169
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,250
I can't understand.

170
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,890
Is there anything here
that is worth you lingering over?

171
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,960
The Yiyue tribe is your home.

172
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,440
Only your tribe people care

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,200
and have him check Qingyu out.

339
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,920
I'll go too.

340
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,570
I've been learning to draw charms
for a while,

341
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
so maybe I can help too.

342
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,960
[Little Devil God is willing to open up
and return to good.]

343
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,290
[He is asking to help others.]

344
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,850
[Li Susu,]

345
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,640
[you are achieving remarkable results.]

346
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,640
OK, let's go together.

347
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:58,960
Miss Pian Ran.

348
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Why are you here?

349
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,730
When did you come?

350
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,920
Last night.

351
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,010
Who allowed you
to stay the night at my home?

352
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,400
Last night, I wanted to

353
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,530
visit you and then leave.

354
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,120
But you got too drunk,

355
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,600
and wouldn't let me leave whatsoever.

356
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,400
So did you sit all night on the ground?

357
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,680
Don't worry.

358
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,810
I've been sitting here all night.

359
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,640
I never had any…

360
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,010
Why didn't you come to bed?

361
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,050
Are you that one-track-minded?

362
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,680
Since you are here,

363
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,490
have lunch before you leave.

364
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,250
OK.

365
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,090
Look at your hesitant face,

366
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,680
as if I'm going to devour you alive.

367
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,050
You're joking.

368
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,400
I'm not joking.

369
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,250
Alright,

370
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,330
since I owe you my life,

371
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,570
you can do whatever you want to me.

372
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,120
What did you say?

373
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,850
Three months ago,
after the Jia Pass battle,

374
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,640
in Mount Mituo.

375
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,090
We met there.

376
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,200
Am I right?

377
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,640
So similar.

378
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,200
It's you.

379
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,530
I recognized you yesterday at first sight.

380
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,960
But I didn't mention the past,
not wanting to startle you.

381
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,010
Please forgive me.

382
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,010
Startle me?

383
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:08,960
Yes.

384
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,810
Ye Qingyu,

385
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
do you know what I am?

386
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,530
I do.

387
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,730
I was once a disciple

388
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,880
of the Xiaoyao Sect in Mount Buzhao.

389
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,640
I can tell demonic energy.

390
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,050
So you knew I was a demon
the moment we met.

391
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,290
Yet you pretended to be nice
and walked me home.

392
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,250
I couldn't help myself.

393
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,600
Sorry.

394
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,570
What if I don't forgive you?

395
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,090
I'm at your mercy.

396
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,640
That's what you said.

397
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,330
Regretting won't change anything.

398
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,400
To save you that day,

399
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,490
it consumed a lot of my cultivation.

400
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,850
I want it back with interest today.

401
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,090
Miss Xiwu,

402
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,850
let's just forget about it.

403
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,050
It's New Year's Day
and I've done the divination.

404
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,050
Today is not a good day to catch demons.

405
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,680
Not a good day.

406
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,850
Then what is good to do today?

407
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,400
Weddings, funerals and family visits.

408
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,680
Even sleeping at home by the fireplace

409
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,250
and petting cats

410
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,090
would be better
than going out to catch demons.

411
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,290
That's ignorant of me.

412
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:25,920
Scholar Pang,

413
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,010
so this is how your Xiaoyao Sect

414
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,680
teaches your disciples?

415
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,400
Do you have to tell your fortune

416
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,920
before you catch demons to save people,

417
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,330
and see if it's a good time?

418
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,570
We should hurry up and go.

419
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,400
If we delay any longer,

420
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,160
Ye Qingyu's would be swallowed

421
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
by the demon and nothing's gonna be left.

422
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,090
Exactly.

423
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,680
Just cut the crap and go.

424
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,490
Wait.

425
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,640
Take this.

426
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,850
Take this.

427
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,250
Miss Xiwu,

428
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,120
you have to come back unscathed,

429
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,010
or General Ye

430
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,640
will rip my head off.

431
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
I got you. Let's go.

432
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,440
See no evil.

433
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,490
[Is Little Devil God learning how to…]

434
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:42,810
What's that?

435
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
The spirit of a human.

436
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,010
Hurry up.

437
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,570
Is Ye Qingyu going to be drained?

438
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,440
Not so serious.

439
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,440
He will only lose some energy.

440
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,290
Easy for you to say.

441
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,120
Wait here.

442
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,530
Ye Xiwu.

443
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,290
Miss Xiwu,

444
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,850
she's just teasing Ye Qingyu.

445
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,290
In fact, she's not hurting him at all.

446
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,160
Qingyu…

447
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,120
Lady,

448
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,330
please calm down and listen to me.

449
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,090
Let my brother go.

450
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,850
Are you his sister?

451
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,730
Lady,

452
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,570
I have heard some about

453
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,920
demons cultivating.

454
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,330
But sucking people's energy

455
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,600
is not the righteous way.

456
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,400
You should cultivate on your own,
and that is the right way.

457
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,880
Shut up!

458
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,120
I know there is a sect.

459
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,530
They never discriminate
against the disciples,

460
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,530
whether they are humans or demons.

461

Miss Xiwu,

475
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,850
I can't move a step,

476
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
so I have to guard the gate.

477

I'll hand you the job of catching her

It's called the Thousand Thunder Tactic.

480
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,960
Once you touch it, your cultivation
of a hundred years will be wasted.

I merely wanted to enhance my power.

508
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,080
What's wrong with that?

509
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,000
I can't believe you were
attacking me for a demon.

510
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,040
Escaping?

511
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,080
What do you want?

512
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,130
My dear husband,

513
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,210
don't leave!

514
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,080
Don't forget we are a married couple.

515
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,000
If you leave,

516
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,730
I'll feel sad.

517
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,210
[It's a demonic hex from that fox.]

518
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,290
Ye Xiwu,

519
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,290
your life

520
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,400
is in my hands this time.

521
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,920
Unexpectedly, things went so smoothly.

522
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,710
His Highness wants to go back
to Jing Kingdom to claim the throne.

523
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,590
Tantai Minglang has always
hated the Yiyue tribe.

524
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
If he had the throne,

525
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,790
the Yiyue tribe would be in danger.

526
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
We came all the way to find Tantai Jin.

527
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,590
Luckily, he is willing to join us.

528
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,960
Our hard work paid off.

529
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,670
High Priestess,
why didn't you tell His Highness

530
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,040
our actual purpose?

531
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,000
You don't know Tantai Jin well.

532
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,150
He is cold and aloof by nature,

533
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,150
yet he desires care and attention.

534
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,150
The less we display selfishness,

535
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,360
the smoother things will go.

536
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,920
It's good for both him and us.

537
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,270
But wouldn't that be using him?

538
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,040
He has the bloodline of the Princess,

539
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,270
so I think we should be loyal to him.

540
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,310
It's always been hard
for the Yiyue tribe to survive.

541
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,400
Now we are doing our best
to help him return to his home.

542
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,750
How is that using him?

543
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,840
You are still young.

544
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,400
Things in this world
are not all black and white.

545
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,840
Even if you want to be loyal,

546
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,880
you don't have to be
candid about everything.

547
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,000
As long as we don't hurt him,

548
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,440
What's wrong with achieving our goal?

549
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,270
But…

550
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:28,840
Enough.

551
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,790
The agreed time is up.

552
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,080
He is still not here.

553
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,440
Go check it out.

554
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,960
OK.

555
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,710
It's him.

556
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,520
Nian Baiyu, leading Moonshadow Guards,

557
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,080
welcome Your Highness.

558
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,000
You may rise.

559
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,040
Your Highness,

560
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,120
who is this?

561
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,270
Ye Xiwu.

562
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,790
Are you taking her with us?

563
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,400
Auntie Lan'an, do you think
I shouldn't take her?

564
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,710
I don't dare to disobey you.

565
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,670
It's just… I heard

566
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,230
Miss Xiwu throws
her weight about everywhere.

567
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,000
She has been disrespectful toward you
for a long time.

568
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,040
Your Highness, you are returning

569
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,600
to claim the throne

570
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,190
and unify the world.

571
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,230
Why don't you kill this woman

572
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,630
to boost our courage?

573
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,750
Ye Xiwu is utterly stupid,

574
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,040
but her father holds
the military power of Sheng Kingdom.

575
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,600
It won't be late to kill her
after I make use of her.

576
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,520
It's wise of you, Your Highness.

577
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,560
Xiwu is your biological sister.

578
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,150
She is now missing

579
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,630
because of that demon.

580
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,710
You are killing me!

581
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
I'm willing to take

582
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,040
any punishment for my misdeeds.

583
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,080
But the most important thing
right now is Xiwu's safety.

584
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,310
That's right, Grandma.

585
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,750
Stop scolding Qingyu.

586
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
It's urgent to find her.

587
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,270
How do you expect me to live

588
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,440
if something happens to Xiwu?

589
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,600
Mother,

590
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,040
don't be agitated.

591
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,270
General Ye!

592
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,920
General Ye!

593
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,440
Scholar Pang had met Ye Xiwu.

594
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,670
General Ye,

595
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,790
Today, Miss Xiwu took me to catch a demon.

596
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,400
It was my fault that
I only guarded outside the gate.

597
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,710
What did that demon do to Xiwu?

598
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,120
That Heptatail Fox only escaped.

599
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,480
When I realized it,

600
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,670
I barged into the building
to search for her.

601
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,000
Then I found out
Tantai Jin took Miss Xiwu away.

602
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,040
That's strange.

603
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,880
What did Tantai Jin take Xiwu away for?

604
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:55,960
Zhong Tai!

605
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,600
Here!

606
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,880
Go to Chen Xian.

607
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,400
Send Dragon Guards to seal the city gates

608
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,350
and search the whole city.

609
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,960
The ferry on the east of the city
leads to Jing Kingdom directly.

610
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,440
Take a team over there now

611
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,710
and stop all the boats.

612
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,600
OK.

613
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,000
Your Highness,

614
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
do you mean…

615
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,440
Tantai Jin may escape Sheng Kingdom…

616
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,310
Currently, Jing Kingdom is
in an unstable situation.

617
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,080
Now the hostage prince runs away

618
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,600
from Ye family.

619
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,520
My father will be suspicious of you.

620
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,270
Seal the ferry.

621
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,120
Search the boats one by one.

622
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:47,960
Yes, sir.

623
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,350
Have more eyes on the river.

624
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,310
OK.

625
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
Check over there.

626
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,310
OK.

627
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,040
High Priestess,

628
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,520
everything has been arranged.

629
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,310
Miss Ye is locked in the cabin,

630
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,920
and I tied her with Ruo-River ropes,

631
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,040
so she won't get away.

632
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,920
You've grown up in a flash.

633
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,000
Mr. Nian,

634
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,040
why are you loyal to the Yiyue tribe?

635
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,750
The old Chief has saved the Nians…

636
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,000
That's the last generation's business.

637
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,400
I'm asking you.

638
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,400
I want to know your own thoughts.

639
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,830
As long as His Highness takes the throne

640
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,920
and protects the Yiyue tribe,

641
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,480
he will be my new master.

642
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,000
The Yiyue tribe is my home.

643
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,960
I was born there and brought up there.

644
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,230
My family is there.

645
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,710
Family…

646
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,790
High Priestess,

647
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,350
I'm sorry.

648
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,920
I was absent without leave back then,

649
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,440
and lost Miss Fuya.

650
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,520
I told you, that's the past.

651
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
Don't mention the past anymore.

652
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,000
I can't blame that on you.

653
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,830
Luckily, we got His Highness back.

654
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,670
You and your Moonshadow Guards

655
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,750
can take a break for now,

656
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,350
but don't let your guard down.

657
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,830
If the Sheng people find out
they've lost the hostage prince,

658
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,000
they will take action.

659
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:17,750
Yes.

660
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,150
Go.

661
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:30,920
[Fuya,]

662
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,710
[my girl,
I promise I will bring you home.]

663
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,040
[So cold.]

664
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,830
[What's this place…]

665
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,520
Stop struggling.

666
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
We took your charms away.

667
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,480
Also, this rope is made by the Yiyue tribe

668
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,120
with Ruo River water.

669
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,000
You can't untie it even with your spells.

670
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,750
So, what are you doing here?

671
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,000
To laugh at me
that I can't untie the rope?

672
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Or are you here to kill me?

673
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,190
The journey is long and boring,

00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:45,830
so I'm here to chat with you.

675
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,000
Didn't you say that

676
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,630
I can come to you

677
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,920
when I want to chat with someone?

678
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,960
I was stupid to trust you.

679
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
Doesn't matter.

680
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,120
Whether you want to or not,

681
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,920
willing or not,

682
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,310
you can only sit here and listen.

683
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,670
You must be wondering

684
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,270
how come the weak me

685
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,350
can devour the demonic elixir,

686
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,230
why there would be a team of guards,

687
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,190
and where and when all this started.

688
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,600
Does that matter?

689
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,270
I should have known earlier

690
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,230
that you were born this way.

691
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,190
You are an ungrateful man.

692
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,040
Ye Xiwu,

693
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,040
I don't think you are innocent.

694
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,150
You are stupid.

695
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,960
You don't even know

696
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,880
why you married me.

697
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,080
What do you mean?

698
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,920
Have you ever wondered the reason?

699
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,080
You clearly sent people

700
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,120
to poison Ye Bingchang's dessert

701
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,120
with Love Fury,

702
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,230
but why did you

703
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,560
finally fall victim to it?

704
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,350
[The night before
the Qixi Festival banquet, in the palace,]

705
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,270
[I noticed a servant]

706
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,270
[tampering with
the desserts of the banquet.]

707
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,920
Well done.

708
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,960
After they both take Love Fury,

709
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,000
they will surely have some fun together.

710
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,600
But she is your sister after all.

711
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,710
Are you going too far by doing this?

712
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,960
What's so good about Ye Bingchang?

713
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,630
She has been pretending

714
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,190
to be pitiful and weak

715
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,790
all day.

716
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,190
I want her to lose her virginity,

717
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:45,000
particularly to that

718
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,150
fat and greasy Prince Wuning.

719
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,880
I want everyone to laugh at her.

720
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,080
I want Xiao Lin to
think of her as a nasty woman,

721
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,150
and lose interest in her.

722
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,270
You can go back.

723
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,040
Wait and see tomorrow night's big show.

724
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,630
Yes.

725
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,040
[I had a difficult life in the palace,]

726
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,150
[cornered to a desperate state.]

727
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,560
[Because of your plot,]

728
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,440
[I could have a great chance]

729
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,560
to leave the Palace of Sheng.

730
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,750
It was you who swapped

731
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,000
Ye Bingchang's and my desserts.

732
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,880
You also set up a scheme

733
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,880
to eat Xiao Liang's dessert.

734
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,190
[I was planning on
knocking over his snack,]

735
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,270
[but he took the initiative to
give me a hard time.]

736
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,830
[It took me no effort
to make my plan work.]

737
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,830
[Why didn't you choose my sister?]

738
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,000
The Love Fury was originally for her.

739
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,120
This was your evil plan.

740
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,630
So of course, you were the perfect choice
to fulfill my plan.

741
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,630
Also, you are
General Ye's favorite daughter.

742
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,120
If I want to escape
from the palace to save my life,

743
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,120
marrying you is a correct option.

744
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,600
You have schemed so much,

745
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,310
yet you still pretend

746
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,270
to be innocent
and victimized in front of me,

747
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:57,670
making me feel pity and guilt toward you.

748
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,400
Ye Xiwu,

749
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,750
as a hostage prince,

750
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,190
I was living in degradation
in the Sheng Kingdom

751
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,190
and my life and death
were not in my own hands.

752
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,270
What else could I do

753
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,710
but endure and make concessions?

754
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,750
Let me tell you one more thing.

755
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,230
That night,

756
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,440
we were only lying next to each other.

757
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,270
Nothing happened between us.

758
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,710
[You are evil and stupid.]

759
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,270
[I would rather endure]

760
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,750
[the heart-wrenching pain from Love Fury,]

761
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,670
than be intimate with you
for even a second.

762
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,440
That's great.

763
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,190
Thank you very much, Tantai Jin.

764
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,670
In the future,

765
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,960
we will have nothing
to do with each other.

766
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,600
Future?

767
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,480
Do you still think you have a future,

768
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,630
the forthcoming?

769
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,440
Dream on.

770
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,520
I won't keep anyone

771
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,310
who knows too many of my secrets alive.

772
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,880
The people who know your secrets…

773
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,670
[This is Nanny Yingxin.]

774
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,080
They want to harm His Highness.

775
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,040
You will harm His Highness.
You will harm him!

776
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,920
Are you talking about Tantai Jin?

777
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,080
Who wanted to harm him?

778
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,270
It wasn't me.

779
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,480
Why did Yingxin go crazy?

780
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,150
You made her go mad.

781
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,350
She colluded with Tantai Minglang

782
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,520
and tried to kill me.

783
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,600
Can't I fight back?

784
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,440
The food today
is unexpectedly substantial.

785
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,040
Your Highness,
you are about to wed Miss Xiwu,

786
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,230
so the royal kitchen
sent the dishes to show kindness.

787
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,120
[Prince Minglang said]

788
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,670
the hostage prince
should never leave the palace.

789
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,710
Tantai Minglang wants me to kill him?

790
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,190
If you are willing to
help us with this favor,

791
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,710
we will find a way to help you

792
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,270
leave the Palace of Sheng

793
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,560
and go back to your hometown.

794
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:07,600
For real?

795
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,190
Yingxin.

796
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,230
Do you remember

797
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,270
a bottle of imperial wine was buried
under the tree outside the gate?

798
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,710
It was given to us by Emperor Sheng
on his birthday one year,

799
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,790
but you wanted to preserve it.

800
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,710
You said that if there was ever a day

801
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,790
we could leave this damned place,

802
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,600
we would open it to celebrate.

803
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,670
Now we can leave the Palace of Sheng.

804
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,920
How about digging it up?

This spell is called "Sketch".

An immortal taught me this spell,

so that my spirit
could wander around the world

45

These monastic people are so aimless.

Instead of improving their cultivation,

50

they choose to waste their time
on such useless things.

51

That's not true.

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,430
The immortals say,

53
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
body, heart, and mind
are three different parts.

54
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,040
When the three parts are unified,
the internal elixir is formed.

But how to unify them?

60

168
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,510
while the second son
is young and promising.

169
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,750
He outshines his father.

170
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,390
No big deal.

171
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,240
Even your ten fingers
are different lengths.

172
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,510
[Ye Mansion]

173
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,550
Who is missing me?

174
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,440
My brother will be back soon, right?

175
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,390
Our house has been in turmoil
since early in the morning.

176
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,150
None of us can get a moment of peace.

177
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,870
I-I can't stand any longer.

178
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm exhausted.

179
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm still injured.

180
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,360
Mr. Qingyu is home.

181
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,080
Greetings, Mr. Qingyu.

182
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
Grandma, Father.

183
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,720
I'm back.

184
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,270
Thanks to God's blessing,

185
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,670
you are home safe and sound.

186
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,790
It was unfilial of me

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,720
to leave Grandma and Father for so long.

188
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,390
Please punish me, Father.

189
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,440
Why would I punish you?

190
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,360
You were guarding the country.

191
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,240
Is there anything more honorable than that?

192
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,870
Although you couldn't stay home
to keep us company,

193
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,270
our ancestors would be very proud of you,

194
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,670
and the people of Sheng admire you.

195
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,790
I'm very proud.

196
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,720
Stand up now.

197
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,270
Up.

198
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,910
Here,

199
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,550
let's start eating.

200
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,390
We waited so long for you to come home.

201
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:51,750
Come on.

202
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't bring up "punishment"
the moment you get back.

203
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,720
Why isn't my sister here?

204
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,910
You mean Xiwu?

205
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,720
She was in the attic last night,
busy with something.

206
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,080
Qingyu,

207
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,390
Xiwu has been studying so hard these days,

208
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,720
forgetting food and sleep.

209
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,910
She probably forgot to eat again.

210
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,440
Let's just

211
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,120
send her some food later.

212
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,870
Yes.

213
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,910
That's not appropriate.

214
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,390
Grandma and Father are both waiting here.

215
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,720
How could a junior be absent?

216
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,480
Qingyu.

217
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,840
Xiwu,

218
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,320
Xiwu is still a kid.

219
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
She is in her 20s

220
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,750
and a married woman.

221
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,600
Xiwu has married
into another family anyway…

222
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,150
Married or not,

223
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,550
everything she says and

224
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,600
does represent our family tradition.

225
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,480
Well…

226
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,840
Though having been
at the border these years,

227
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,960
I have also heard of

228
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
Xiwu's infamous behaviors.

229
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,480
She maltreated our servants,

230
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,440
pushed Bingchang into the water,

231
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,110
got drunk and lost her virginity
in the imperial palace,

232
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,400
and even got married muddleheadedly.

233
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
That's right, Qingyu.

234
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,400
You should discipline Ye Xiwu.

235
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,270
Look at my injuries!

236
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,550
On the wedding day of Prince Lin,

237
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,880
an evil bird made a ruckus in our house.

238
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,880
Xiwu left us outside

239
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,480
and rushed back to save her husband,

240
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,270
protecting outsiders.

241
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,480
She's not worthy of her last name Ye!

242
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,400
Zeyu,

243
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,880
as a Ye,

244
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,750
you failed to help someone in need
and protect your sisters,

245
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,750
yet you have the nerve to criticize Xiwu.

246
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,590
At least Xiwu was trying to save someone.

247
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,030
Who were you trying to protect

248
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,920
when getting these wounds?

249
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,590
I'm starving.

250
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,350
I feel so dizzy.

251
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,550
I can't hear anything clearly.

252
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,030
Xiwu has always been unruly.

253
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm afraid after I left,

254
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,510
no one was here to teach her how to behave.

255
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
I need to go check on her.

256
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,310
Qingyu!

257
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,830
Chuntao, go and help Xiwu out!

258
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,070
Ye Xiwu.

259
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,440
Get up.

260
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,640
We got company.

261
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,920
Let me sleep a little longer.

262
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,240
Someone is coming here. Time for lunch.

263
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,830
Let me sleep.

264
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,550
Tell Chuntao to save some food for me.

265
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,030
This is ridiculous!

266
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,110
Your Ladyship!

267
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,240
Your Ladyship, you…

268
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,590
Why are you yelling?

269
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,790
Who was here?

270
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,310
Your brother, Ye Qingyu.

271
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,350
Yes, Your Ladyship.

272
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,350
Why are you still sleeping here?

273
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
Mr. Qingyu came home today!

274
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,590
What does Qingyu's return
have to do with me?

275
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,790
[Got beaten in the palm after all.]

276
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,110
[What will come will come.]

277
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,270
[I can't escape my destiny.]

278
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,640
[Oh no.]

279
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,350
[How come Qingyu
is even more overbearing than Ye Xiwu?]

280
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,270
Ye Xiwu,

281
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,310
Grandma and Father were waiting
in the dining room today,

282
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,960
but you were absent for no reason.

283
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,240
That was unfilial.

284
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,920
Your brother came back
from thousands of miles away,

285
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,030
and Father and Grandma were there
to welcome me home, yet only you weren't.

286
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,110
That was disrespectful.

287
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,440
You are married,

288
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,510
but you were doing…

289
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,510
doing licentious acts in broad daylight.

290
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
That was shameless.

291
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,110
I was away from home for three years
and neglected to discipline you.

292
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,590
How could you become such a rascal?

293
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
I am unworthy of Ye's glory.

294
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,790
I've realized my mistakes.

295
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,640
Since you've realized your mistakes,

296
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,750
and I just got home,
I won't punish you too harshly.

297
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,030
Kneel here for half an hour

298
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,270
and introspect on your behavior.

299
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,240
Your Ladyship, straighten your back.

300
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,000
If Mr. Qingyu sees you like this,

301
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,680
he will make you kneel
for another half an hour.

302
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,310
But as the younger brother,

303
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,960
he shouldn't teach me a lesson.

304
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,750
Even the oldest brother is scared of me.

305
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,160
But he has the power.

306
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,550
He is our home supervisor.

307
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,030
I thought the supervisor was my dad.

308
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,200
Yes, it used to be him,

309
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,030
but he doesn't like too much red tape,

310
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,830
so when dealing with a lot of things,

311
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,400
he always muddles through them.

312
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
But people in Sheng take

313
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,590
clans and etiquette very seriously.

314
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,030
[Clan Patriarchs]
[Then one time, Master found it too much work,]

315
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,790
[memorial tablet]
[so he gave all the worship ceremony work]

316
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,790
[to Mr. Qingyu.]

317
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,070
[Unexpectedly, Mr. Qingyu did a great job,]

318
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,440
[much better than Master.]

319
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,920
[Ever since that,]

320
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,510
[Mr. Qingyu was voted to be the supervisor]

321
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,070
[by all Ye members.]

322
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,680
[Clan Patriarchs]

323
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,240
[Sure, some became prime ministers
at the age of 12,]

324
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,550
but just how unreliable was my dad

325
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,440
that got the whole clan to approve

326
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,790
of this brat becoming the family head?

327
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,960
Don't say that about the Master,

328
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,110
or Mr. Qingyu will punish you again.

329
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
When is Qingyu going to leave?

330
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,240
After the Spring Festival, the earliest.

331
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,880
Your Ladyship.

332
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,200
Your Ladyship.

333
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,640
Y-Your Ladyship.

334
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,110
Who is the home supervisor
beating this time?

335
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,920
Mr. Qingyu went to your husband.

336
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,550
[Ye Qingyu is so fierce.]

337
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,200
[If he finds out that Tantai Jin is evil,]

338
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,920
[my brother will get rid
of him immediately.]

339
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,550
Your Ladyship,

340
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,310
Your Ladyship, be careful.

341
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,920
The universe manifests in an inch of land.
The soul follows the mind.

342
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,590
Prince Tantai.

343
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,110
I've heard a lot about you.

344
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Whatever you heard about

345
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,480
is probably not something good.

346
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,030
Slanders and rumors can ruin a person,

347
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,160
but I believe in seeing with my own eyes.

348
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,720
You came here

349
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,000
not to chitchat with me, right?

350
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,550
Firstly,

351
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,790
I want to apologize
for all of Xiwu's misbehavior.

352
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,880
Secondly,

353
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,920
I want to invite you
to a meal with me one day.

354
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,030
Lastly,

355
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,310
my sister is ignorant and unruly,

356
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,310
so please don't let her
mess around in the future.

357
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,200
For example,
her shameful act earlier today.

358
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,510
If word gets out about it,

359
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,070
the Ye family's
and your reputation will be stained.

360
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,830
Shameful act.

361
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,790
Why don't you be straight and tell me

362
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,640
what exactly we were doing?

363
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,720
I can just let it go.

364
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,070
I shouldn't interfere

365
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,590
in your private matters.

366
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,920
But there is another thing

367
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,960
I want to ask you about.

368
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,160
What is it?

369
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,550
Earlier,

370
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,680
were you chanting a spell?

371
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,240
You misheard.

372
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,240
I cultivated in Xiaoyao Sect
for three years.

373
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,110
Although not a master,

374
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,160
I can tell when one is chanting a spell.

375
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,790
Does Xiwu know about this?

376
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,680
Does my father know about it?

377
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,480
You want to know if Ye Xiwu knows,

378
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,750
then why don't you go ask her yourself?

379
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,200
I grew up with Xiwu.

380
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,070
Ahough naughty and mischievous,

381
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,070
she is careless.

382
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,590
She can be easily deceived.

383
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,160
Prince Tantai,

384
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,000
I've heard that there have been
frequent disturbances

385
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,110
and rampant demonic activity
in the capital recently.

386
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,880
What does it have to do with me?

387
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,790
The Xuancheng Palace
suffered a disaster on their wedding day.

388
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,720
Many places still urgently need repair

389
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,440
and my eldest brother's injuries
have not yet healed.

390
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,750
Even my father,

391
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,830
Pillar of the State Great General,
has been injured.

392
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,200
I heard you were there too,

393
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,440
but you're unscathed.

394
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,550
So what?

395
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,350
I was just lucky.

396
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,160
Jing Kingdom's royal symbol

397
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,750
is a three-eye crow.

398
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,920
The beast that broke into
Xuanchen Palace that day

399
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
happened to be a crow.

400
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,350
What a coincidence!

401
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,790
General Ye,

402
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,070
considering your amazing imagination,

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,590
it's an awful waste of your talent
to have you defend the border.

404
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,350
Prince Tantai,

405
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,720
I have a spell called Bone Inspect,

406
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,480
which can tell one's nature.

407
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,000
Would you care to try it?

408
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,830
Do you have to do this?

409
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,440
If you are innocent,

410
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,480
what's there to be scared about?

411
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,030
Qingyu,

412
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,680
you misunderstood him.

413
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,400
Is half an hour over so fast?

414
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,110
Not yet.

415
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,110
I'll soon go back to the ancestral hall
to make up for it.

416
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,590
Qingyu,

417
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,200
when the monsters were rampaging,

418
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,550
I was with Tantai Jin the whole time.

419
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,680
He almost died.

420
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,790
It wasn't him. Really.

421
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,480
Let me ask you for the last time:

422
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,200
have you been secretly studying spells?

423
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,920
I thought you were mad over some big deal.

424
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,790
Yes, he is practicing spells.

425
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,270
I learned some simple spells recently,

426
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,310
and I thought it was boring
to practice alone,

427
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,200
so I had Tantai Jin practice with me.

428
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,920
But he is so dumb

429
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,960
that he can't grasp them at all.

430
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,070
That's why he was secretly
practicing in the room.

431
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,920
So that's what you are worried about.

432
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,480
What's so secretive about it?

433
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Why couldn't you just tell him?

434
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,200
Learning spells?

435
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,000
Who did you learn spells from?

436
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,480
Remember there were demons in the capital?

437
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,000
I had Scholar Pang teach me a few tricks.

438
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,480
Prince Tantai,

439
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,680
I was rude to you just now.

440
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,720
My apologies.

441
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,270
Xiwu,

442
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,070
I just told Prince Tantai,

443
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,480
since we are family,

444
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,510
he shouldn't eat alone at a single table.

445
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,200
Starting tomorrow,
he may dine with us.

446
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,720
Great. I agree.

447
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,070
You made a very wise decision.

448
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,480
[You only care about eating.]

449
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,590
[Just now if it weren't for me,]

450
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,160
[you might've been killed.]

451
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,640
Qingyu.

452
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,960
Speaking of spells,
can you perform magic as well?

453
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,030
The Bone Inspect spell
you were talking about…

454
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,160
Fake, just to intimidate him.

455
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,240
[I was scared to death.]

456
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, well, Tantai Jin.

457
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,240
Ignorance is bliss.

458
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,310
You are so ignorant and so blessed.

459
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,030
Mr. Qingyu.

460
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,400
Mr. Qingyu.

461
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,640
Prince Xuanchen sent people
to invite you over.

462
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,240
His Highness said that
after being long parted from you,

463
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,000
he misses you very much.

464
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,830
He invited you to his place to catch up.

465
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,240
Get the horse ready.

466
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,790
Yes.

467
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,070
[Ye Mansion]

468
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,830
General Ye,

469
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,440
it turns out you are also a disciple
from our Mount Buzhao.

470
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,270
Your Highness, I wouldn't figure it out
if you didn't say anything.

471
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,880
Descendants from Sheng's official families

472
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,350
are most likely sent to immortal sects

473
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,920
for a few years of cultivation,

474
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,880
no matter whether they are talented or not.

475
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,400
It's something of a tradition now.

476
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,920
It's normal that Scholar Pang can't tell.

477
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,310
Unlike His Highness,

478
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,790
I don't have his talent in
making elixirs and cultivating.

479
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,550
I only fit in armies, playing with weapons.

480
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,550
You are joking, General Ye.

481
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,480
A talent like you

482
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,350
can even be humble about your gift,

483
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,110
then I would be a parasite of your kingdom.

484
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,070
I heard the emperor of Jing has died.

485
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,790
If the news is true,

486
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,830
I don't know what kind of disturbance
the world will suffer.

487
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,350
You don't need to worry.

488
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,000
Tantai Wuji died of a severe illness,

489
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,510
and his throne would fall into
Tantai Minglang's hands.

490
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,310
I heard this man is paranoid
and bad-tempered.

491
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If he succeeds to the throne,

492
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,070
I'm afraid
Jing Kingdom itself will be in trouble.

493
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,310
As the saying goes,
"the rise brings suffering to the people,

494
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,750
and the fall also
brings suffering to the people."

495
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,350
It has been like this since ancient times.

496
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,680
Your Highness,

497
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,350
although Jing Kingdom is an enemy,

498
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,000
their soldiers and civilians

499
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,830
are all flesh and blood,

500
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,830
no different from us.

501
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,350
General Ye, you are very broad-minded.

502
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,830
I feel ashamed of my shallowness.

503
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,590
As the guardian general of the borders,
I receive the salary from the court.

504
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,030
I am duty-bound to protect Sheng
with all my heart and effort.

505
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,590
However, deep down in my heart,

506
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,590
I hope there will be
no more wars in the world,

507
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,480
and one day the countries can be reunified.

508
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,000
But the hostility between the two kingdoms
has been there for years.

509
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,270
I wonder which powerful lord
will have such courage,

510
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,240
and in which year and month
this will happen.

511
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,480
Your Highness,

512
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,310
if someday you become the emperor
of Sheng,

513
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,240
I…

514
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,720
General Ye,

515
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,030
my father is in his prime.

516
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,550
You should not have said such things.

517
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,640
I spoke out of turn.
Please punish me, Your Highness.

518
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,110
Don't be like this.

519
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,790
The general trend of the world

520
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,830
is that what has been divided
must be united, and vice versa.

521
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,440
You mortals should accept this reality.

522
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,350
How about this?

523
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,440
I'll conduct fortune-telling for you guys.

524
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,960
What fortune?

525
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,590
What's the matter?

526
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,110
According to the divination result,

527
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,680
the person who can end the chaos,
pacify the empire,

528
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,070
and bring happiness to the people

529
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,480
is now in Sheng's capital city.

530
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,000
Let me check again.

531
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,920
[That day, I devoured the succubus,]

532
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,110
[and it gave me temporary power,]

533
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,400
[but it ran out very quickly.]

534
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,510
[My body's yearning for demonic powers]

535
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,510
[seems to be insatiable.]

536
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,750
[Why is this happening?]

537
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,310
Ye Qingyu suspects me,

538
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,310
and Ye Xiwu follows me around every day.

539
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,640
I have to figure out another way

540
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,480
to find new demonic power.

541
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,590
Mr. Qingyu.

542
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,160
Chuntao,

543
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,720
have you seen Mr. Zeyu?

544
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,000
Mr. Zeyu…

545
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,920
He went out early in the morning

546
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,790
after borrowing thirty taels from Miss.

547
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,200
He probably went again to the…

548
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,510
How dare you, Ye Zeyu!

549
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,270
Big!

550
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,070
Big!

551
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,830
Big!

552
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,550
Another round?

553
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,240
Yes.

554
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,070
For each round you lose,
you have to take off a piece of clothing.

555
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,400
Mr. Zeyu, you have just taken off one,

556
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,000
and if you lose one more time,

557
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
you'll

558
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,790
be stripped naked.

559
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,240
So what?

560
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,350
You, a girl, can watch me
without feeling shy,

561
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,070
then why would I flinch?

562
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,000
Let's start.

563
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
Another round, then.

564
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,790
Sir, please stop.

565
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,510
Who are you looking for?

566
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,720
Ye Zeyu.

567
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,790
Is he inside?

568
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,920
What is it you want to see him about?

569
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,310
Tell me so I can inform him for you.

570
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,590
I'm here to break his legs.

571
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,780
[Gamble House]

572
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,440
My ancestors, please bless me.

573
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,440
I need to win once!

574
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,760
You don't want to see me

575
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,030
become a laughing stock, do you?

576
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,710
Big!

577
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:25,110
Open it!

578
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:25,710
Big!

579
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,960
My ancestors,

580
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,230
you guys are unbelievably hard-hearted!

581
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,880
Strip!

582
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,590
I haven't lost yet. You go!

583
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,960
Go!

584
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,960
Mr. Zeyu, are you quite unlucky today?

585
00:34:45,920 --> 00:35:03,710
Small!

586
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,550
-Small!
-Open!

587
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,550
Bless me.

588
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,960
Open!

589
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:22,110
Small!

590
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,230
Small!

591
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,320
It's small!

592
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,360
It's your turn to undress!

593
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,800
Undress!

594
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,590
Go ahead!

595
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:51,880
Undress!

596
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,070
Who the hell

597
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
dared to hit me?

598
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,320
You did well.

599
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,230
Qingyu, you are here.

600
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,070
Put on your clothes
and go to the ancestral hall.

601
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,480
Kneel there according to
domestic discipline.

602
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,110
Yes.

603
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,880
I'll go right now.

604
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,360
Make way.

605
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,360
Make way for me.

606
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,110
What are you looking at? Look away.

607
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,840
[Ye Qingyu really seems quite powerful.]

608
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,030
[I have to guard against him.]

609
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,480
[My spell skills is progressing slowly,]

610
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,880
[and can be found out easily.]

611
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,670
[It's not nearly
as useful as demonic elixirs.]

612
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,920
[It happens to be Spring Festival,]

613
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,230
[and the streets
are full of the hustle and bustle,]

614
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,630
[suitable for going out and hunting.]

615
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,590
[But Ye Xiwu definitely won't let me out.]

616
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,150
Tantai Jin,

617
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,510
let's go do Spring Festival shopping.

618
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,960
You are looking for trouble yourself.

619
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,280
Why are you dragging me along?

620
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,630
It's not like I'm asking you
to draw a carriage.

621
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,280
Why are you rejecting me?

622
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,800
Everyone should bathe
in the sun more, including you.

623
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,710
In this way, you can get stronger.

624
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,510
Being confined in
that little attic all day long,

625
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,710
you'll become a freak.

626
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,280
[This is just what I want.]

627
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,480
Let's go. Come on.

628
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,630
[Festivals in the mortal world
are so lively.]

629
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,280
[There are more people on this street]

630
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,920
[than the whole of Mount Changze.]

631
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,030
Chuntao, let's get off and walk around.

632
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,070
Your Ladyship, that's delicious too!

633
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,150
You only think about food!

634
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,630
[As Spring Festival approaches,]

635
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,760
[with people coming and going
on the streets,]

636
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,760
[if I look carefully,]

637
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,030
[I should be able to find a monster or two]

638
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,070
[pretending to be people.]

639
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,590
Wait a moment, Sir.

640
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,030
You forgot your cloak.

641
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,110
You can keep it as compensation.

642
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,230
I apologize for my brother.

643
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,440
You are not him.

644
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,480
He owes me,

645
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
but why are you paying back on his behalf?

646
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,030
He owes me a piece of clothing.

647
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,000
Are you, the brother,

648
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,190
going to strip on his behalf
in front of me?

649
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,400
Also, the money he owes me

650
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,800
is far more than the value of a dress.

651
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,190
It's sweet. You want some?

652
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,630
Then I'll eat all of it.

653
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,710
So many people here.

654
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,670
[I can distinctly sense
the demonic power nearby.]

655
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,320
[But where is it hiding exactly?]

656
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,920
Delicious chestnuts.

657
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,000
Take a look here.

658
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,400
Chestnuts!

659
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,360
Let's go!

660
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,710
Miss, would you like some chestnuts?

661
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,230
I'll have some, please.

662
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,030
I'll have some.

663
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,800
Alright.

664
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,800
-Bravo!
-Yeah!

665
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,920
Where are you going?

666
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,070
Let's watch this.

667
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,440
Here, have a taste.

668
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,710
Have a try!

669
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,280
OK.

670
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,190
Look at you,

671
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,360
hiding in that attic all day long.

672
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,550
You won't melt in the sun.

673
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,670
You should come out
for a stroll more often,

674
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,960
enjoying some good snacks
to lift your mood.

675
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,920
Great!

676
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,760
Are you saying

677
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,550
I can come out whenever I want?

678
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,920
Of course.

679
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,630
But I should come with you,

680
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,960
lest you get lost.

681
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,590
[This woman is not dumb.]

682
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,630
[She is still guarded with me.]

683
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,510
Your Ladyship,

684
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,070
there are still so many things to buy.

685
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,710
If we keep hanging around like this,

686
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,110
we won't be done even when it gets dark.

687
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,480
Good point.

688
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,030
I'll leave the carriage to you.

689
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,150
You can go back home
after you get everything.

690
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,000
I'll walk around a little longer.

691
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,630
Let's go.

692
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,150
-Good!
-Great!

693
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,030
Awesome!

694
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
You got rid of all of them?

695
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,670
Yes.

696
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,320
That Ye Xiwu

697
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,710
is inseparable from His Highness.

698
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,360
Those people probably
won't have another chance

699
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,320
to harm His Highness.

700
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
If you want to meet him

701
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,590
under the Ye family's nose,

702
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,230
you have to be cautious.

703
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,630
High Priestess,

704
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,670
Although His Highness
is the princess's son,

705
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,440
he is not so close with the Yiyue tribe.

706
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,760
Also, you had been gone for so long.

707
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,110
What if he refuses to recognize you?

708
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,880
It's not only for the Yiyue tribe,

709
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,800
but also for himself.

710
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,150
Let's go

711
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,760
and find a place to stay the night first.

712
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,320
Yes.

713
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,190
Tantai Jin,

714
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,070
Tantai Jin, what's this?

715
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,960
I don't know.

716
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,190
This is a mud whistle.

717
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,030
Every kid has played with one of these.

718
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,190
Could it be that you two are immortals
who have descended to earth

719
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,710
and do not partake in
the pleasures of mortal life?

720
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,670
[I did come to earth,]

721
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,710
[but I didn't expect Little Devil God
to not recognize this thing.]

722
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,670
[He has been living like a prisoner
since he was a child.]

723
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,000
[Who would buy him toys?]

724
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,590
Here.

725
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,480
[Seeing as how he's looking around]

726
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,710
[with an inexperienced look,]

727
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,800
[I think he is probably just like me,]

728
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,670
[coming to a temple fair
for the first time.]

729
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,880
Tantai Jin,

730
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,840
how about I buy you one?

731
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,840
Ye Xiwu,

732
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,670
were you born yesterday?

733
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,760
Using me as an excuse
to buy toys for yourself.

734
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,510
Fine, it's for me.

735
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,110
Hide!

736
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,320
I didn't expect Qingyu,
who is usually serious,

737
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,440
to come out shopping.

738
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,880
We shopped for half a day.

739
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,480
I think I have paid off

740
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,800
what my brother owes you.

741
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,030
Let me calculate.

742
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,760
The principal has almost been paid off,

743
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,670
but you also need to pay me some interest.

744
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,070
That's a lot of interest.

745
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,360
Of course.

746
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,670
Which color is the prettiest?

747
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:10,760
All good.

748
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,920
Buy lipstick for me,

749
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,320
and the debt you owe me is cleared.

750
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,400
OK.

751
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,550
Put it on for me, then.

752
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,070
I…

753
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,110
Hurry up.

754
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,590
I'll close my eyes
and spare you the embarrassment,

755
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,550
okay?

756
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,230
Gosh.

757
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,030
Did you see that?

758
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,880
Am I pretty?

759
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,880
Am I hallucinating?

760
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,070
Is that really our home supervisor?

761
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,110
Have you had enough fun?

762
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,480
He turned around to us.

763
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,030
I'll buy these two.

764
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,440
-These two.
-OK.

765
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,400
Have a good one.

766
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:42,960
Tantai Jin,

767
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,400
do you smell something strange?

768
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,030
No, not a smell.

769
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,920
I can't tell what it is.

770
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,400
No.

771
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,760
[This is the source
of that demonic energy.]

772
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,840
[I've finally found her.]

773
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,280
[If I can take her demonic elixir…]

774
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,000
Pian Ran, where are you from?

775
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,960
I'm not a Sheng citizen.

776
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,880
My hometown is remote,

777
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,030
and you probably haven't heard of it,
even if I tell you.

778
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,000
So you come from afar.

779
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,150
Do you have any relatives in the capital?

780
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,670
No.

781
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,710
I live by myself.

782
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,840
Alone and nowhere to belong.

783
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,280
If I encounter any trouble in the future,

784
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,190
I might have to go to you for help.

785
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,670
No problem.

786
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,480
You may come to me whenever you need help.

787
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,590
My home is just across the bridge ahead.

788
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,230
Mr. Ye, you have been
running around all day with me.

789
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,190
Would you like to come to my place
for a cup of tea?

790
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,590
Today is the New Year's Eve.
My grandmother is at home,

791
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,510
and I shouldn't stay out for too long.

792
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,880
Alright. No need to ramble on.

793
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,880
I can let you go today.

794
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,510
Mr. Ye, remember to retrieve the cloak
when you have time.

795
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,000
Goodbye.

796
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,070
Mr. Ye,

797
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,440
don't forget, now you owe me a cup of tea.

798
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,400
[This man is likable.]

799
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,880
[Never mind.]

800
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,760
[I'm not in a hurry now.]

801
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,070
[Clothing Market]

802
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,960
This dress is perfect for Grandma.

803
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,920
This one is for Dad.

804
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,070
I'll take this one too.
It fits Chuntao perfectly.

805
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,630
Shopkeeper, please pack them for me.

806
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,440
Let's see what else I need.

807
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Oh, Ye Zeyu!

808
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,400
Come in!

809
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,400
What's wrong?

810
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,360
Try it on for me.

811
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,630
My size is different from Mr. Zeyu's.

812
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,840
I think it fits.

813
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,440
Sir,

814
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,480
I will take this one too.

815
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,960
You don't need to pack it.
We will put it on.

816
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:05,760
Right,

817
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,280
pick several sets of clothes
in this size for each season.

818
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,030
Choose them based on his body measurements.

819
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,550
Pack them all and send them
to General Ye's house.

820
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,400
OK.

821
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,590
Ye Xiwu,

822
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:19,320
is it for me?

823
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,320
Didn't I promise

824
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,670
to buy you a new one before?

825
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,760
I forgot for many days,

826
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,440
I'm sorry.

827
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,760
What are you standing here for? Put it on.

828
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,840
It's getting dark.

829
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,110
Dad and the others will worry about us.

830
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,400
Go.

831
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,630
Chop, chop.

832
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,150
Change into it.

833
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,320
Finally, we've finished shopping.

834
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,190
We can go home to have
New Year's Eve dinner.

835
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,320
It seems taking you with me
was a pretty wise decision.

836
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,710
Firecrackers. Who wants some firecrackers?

837
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,510
Firecrackers!

838
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,150
She is selling firecrackers.

839
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,960
Chuntao has bought some.

840
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,590
Buy some firecrackers!

841
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,440
There's no harm in buying a few more.

842
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,510
Ye Xiwu

843
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,440
Miss, please buy some firecrackers.

844
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,360
Sis,

845
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,320
I'll buy all the firecrackers
in your basket.

846
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,760
I made these firecrackers
with my own hands.

847
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,960
I'm afraid they are not very good-looking.

848
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,550
Don't worry. I like ones like that.

849
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,440
How much do I owe you?

850
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,550
You can pay me 30 pennies.

851
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,510
No,

852
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,150
pay me 20.

853
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,480
Twenty is enough.

854
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:55,840
Here.

855
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,150
No, you shouldn't have.

856
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,030
But…

857
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,510
Miss…

858
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,510
You can have this too.

859
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,150
Happy New Year, sis.

860
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,230
Miss, you don't have to…

861
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,030
I met a kind goddess today.

862
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,550
Why did you buy so many firecrackers?

863
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,110
I like setting them off.
You got a problem with that?

864
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,960
It's so cold.

865
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,110
The sooner she sells all of them,

866
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,000
the earlier she can go home
for the festival.

867
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,510
You bought all of them today,

868
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,590
but tomorrow she will still
be out in the cold to sell them.

869
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,840
Maybe she'll meet

870
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,670
another fool like me tomorrow.

871
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,070
Ye Xiwu,

872
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,360
your small bag of money

873
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,760
can't do much for her.

874
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,070
You are right.

875
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,550
There's no way to rid this world of misery,

876
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,190
and there's nothing I can do
to make a difference.

877
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,230
But,

878
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,880
at least she gets to go home earlier
to celebrate New Year's Eve today.

879
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:42,180

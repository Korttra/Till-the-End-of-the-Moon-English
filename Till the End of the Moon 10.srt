170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
[Fate has never wanted you]

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,750

172
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,200
[It will not leave you
alone in the darkness.]

173
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,270
[Can't you see]

174
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,270
[where your fate should belong?]

175
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
[Rather than live on in degradation,]

176
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,510
[why not put up a fight?]

177
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,790
[All your enemies
who should've be skinned by you]

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
[and that highest throne…]

179
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
[Think about it.]

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,120
[What is it that you should do
and that you deserve to own?]

181
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,510
What's wrong with your eye?

182
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,510
Nothing.

183
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,320
Just a little dust.

184
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,870
Hey, Little Fox.

185
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,790
I told you several times,

186
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,550
call me sister.

187
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Sister Fox,

188
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
we've been out for days.

189
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
If we keep hanging around like this,

190
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,910
when can we get to Barren Abyss?

191
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,360
What's the hurry?

192
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,910
I'm badly injured. I need to rest.

193
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,510
When you were
flirting with someone just now,

194
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,240
your complexion looked great.

195
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,080
For the sake of our friendship,

196
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,910
here's a piece of advice.

197
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,790
You'd better not absorb mortals' vitality

198
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,110
to improve your cultivation.

199
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,360
When you become a demonic cultivator,

200
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,360
you'll eventually
be struck dead by lightning.

201
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,150
I didn't do that for my cultivation.

202
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,030
I simply thought those men were funny.

203
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,390
They can't take a little flirting.

204
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,270
Funny?

205
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,670
Is that how you think of
my second brother?

206
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,550
But I think he's serious about you.

207
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,550
Playing with people's emotions seems fun,

208
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,320
but what if they take it seriously,

209
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,720
or you take it seriously?

210
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,390
Love is something
that often goes out of control.

211
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,000
Little girl,

212
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,390
do you know what love threads are?

213
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,790
All intelligent beings have love threads.

214
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,390
Only with love threads
can you love someone.

215
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,670
But my love threads are lost.

216
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,200
Without them,

217
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,550
I can no longer love anyone.

218
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,390
How did you lose your love threads?

219
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,870
Why would I tell you?

220
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,750
How long exactly
can we get to Barren Abyss?

221
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,120
Going in
or getting out of the abyss isn't easy.

222
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,360
I used to be a nine-tailed fox spirit.

223
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,270
I cut off two tails to get out.

224
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,080
I had to abandon
thousands of years of cultivation.

225
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,600
It's so difficult, even for a demon.

226
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
Much less a mere mortal like you.

227
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,910
Even if you get there, you'll die in vain.

228
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,910
Why must you go there?

229
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,320
I'll go even if it may kill me.

230
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,910
Maybe only in there

231
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,750
can I find the way to save them.

232
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,550
Who are you saving?

233
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,510
A lot.

234
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
Quite a lot of people.

235
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,600
You won't necessarily save them
even if you made it there.

236
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,390
You could probably
lose your life for nothing.

237
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,240
Do think twice.

238
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,870
If I could save them all,

239
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,200
my life would mean nothing.

240
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,270
Either by your help

241
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,270
or any other way,

242
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,750
I must be there.

243
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,720
Fine.

244
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,440
I wanted to

245
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
stop you

246
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,790
because you saved my life,

247
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,630
but since you're so stubborn,

248
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,270
let's hit the road when the day breaks.

249

you gave up your life for father.

253
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,790
But I won't do the same.

254
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,190
Those who laughed at me and insulted me,

255
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,280
I've killed every last one of them.

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,390
[Now the tyrant is dead.
The new King shall rule.]

335
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,240
[May this wise King benefit us on and on!]

336
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,550
[May this diligent King shine on and on!]

337
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,280
[Jing Kingdom,]

338
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,280
[I have returned after all.]

339
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,390
You killed your mother
the moment you were born.

340
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,790
You left the capital at six.

341
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,000
Now you're back for no reason at all.

342
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,790
You don't deserve to be our king!

343
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,480
You don't deserve it!

344
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,310
You're the son of a demonic Yiyue woman

345
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,110
who could control demon creatures.

346
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,150
Now you're back to the Jing.

347
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,920
You must have an evil plan!

348
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,760
-That's right!
-Yeah.

349
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,350
Evil plan!

350
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,550
If we surrender to you,

351
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,960
how will the history books describe us?

352
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,070
-Yeah!
-Exactly!

353
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,760
How will the history books write about us?

354
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,480
Answer us!

355
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,550
Have you said enough?

356
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,110
Kill us if you want!

357
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,960
Even if we die here today,

358
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,830
we won't take you as our new king!

359
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,590
-Yeah!
-That's right!

360
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,680
You're not our new king!

361
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,830
-Kill us!
-Yeah!

362
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,390
Come on!

363
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,680
Just kill us!

364
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,550
-Kill me!
-Come kill us!

365
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,350
Come on, kill us!

366
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,350
Ministers,

367
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,590
please calm down.

368
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,350
What should I kill you for?

369
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,110
Serve it.

370
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,630
Could it be some demonic creature?

371
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,200
This is…

372
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,830
Soup?

373
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,590
Are we having dinner?

374
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,200
After talking for quite a while,

375
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,720
you must be hungry.

376
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,520
I specially prepared dinner for you.

377
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,920
Let's talk while dining.

378
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,110
Guards.

379
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,440
Treat them properly for me.

380
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,240
Yes.

381
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,280
Is this even the time to have soup?

382
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,920
All of you are so loyal to the late king.

383
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,680
I'm so touched.

384
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,920
Certainly I should treat you

385
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,070
to the best cuisine.

386
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,070
Make sure you drink it all in one gulp,

387
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,200
so as not to let

388
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,590
my admiration for you go in vain.

389
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,520
Why are you not eating?

390
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,000
Does my food not suit your taste?

391
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,870
I have to admit that

392
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,280
the meat soup
from Yiyue Tribe tastes great!

393
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,000
This…

394
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,040
This soup could be poisonous!

395
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
Poisonous!

396
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,150
You!

397
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,680
You're so wicked!

398
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,000
What now?

399
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,630
Spit it out!

400
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,440
I'm not into the idea of poisoning.

401
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,070
Your old king is already dead.

402
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,960
You're all patriotic ministers.

403
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,150
I returned as the new King timely

404
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,070
to save the people
of the Jing from disasters.

405
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,070
Shouldn't you all be delighted about it?

406
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,960
Guards.

407
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,920
Another bowl
for those who haven't had enough.

408
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,830
Whoever willing to
share this soup with me,

409
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,630
I will treat you well.

410
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,200
I won't force you to stay

411
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,240
if you still don't change your mind.

412
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,480
I'll grant your wish
to be the tomb keepers

413
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,200
of the late king until you think

414
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,960
you've missed him enough.

415
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,830
What should we do?

416
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,720
Forget it.

417
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,000
He's the only Tantai left.

418
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,310
The kingdom cannot be without a king.

419
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,590
Everyone,

420
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,310
are you satisfied with my treatment today?

421
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
I'm satisfied.

422
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm willing to share this soup with you.

423
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,350
I'm satisfied.

424
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Thanks, Your Majesty!

425
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,070
Escort my ministers back to rest.

426
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,920
Yes.

427
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,150
Thanks, Your Majesty!

428
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,520
Let's go, come on.

429
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Tantai Minglang is dead.

430
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,070
The new King of the Jing

431
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,680
is Tantai Jin?

432
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,680
Tantai Jin
has been a hostage here for years.

433
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,150
A helpless prince like him

434
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,960
inherited the throne
just days after returning?

435
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,040
What a big joke!

436
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,590
This shows the end of the Jing is near.

437
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,000
Now he hasn't established his authority.

438
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,630
This is

439
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,350
our perfect chance to attack Jing.

440
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,760
War spends blood and treasure.

441
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,200
Yeah.

442
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,790
There's a flood in the south.
People are starving.

443
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,280
We haven't had disaster relief food yet.

444
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,550
Our national treasury is empty.

445
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,790
Father,

446
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,110
I think we'd better not go to war.

447
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,000
We just fought
for three months in Jia Pass.

448
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,350
Now our soldiers are tired.

449
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,590
Our provisions are running low.

450
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,590
Building up strength is the better choice.

451
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,590
Also, if he can seize
the throne as a hostage prince,

452
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,920
he's probably capable of more.

453
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
We can't underestimate Tantai Jin.

454
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,790
Yes, Prince Lin's words make sense.

455
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,040
Back then, when General Ye
crushed Jing Kingdom,

456
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,960
and we took Tantai Jin our hostage.

457
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,870
So that the Jing bowed it head to us.

458
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,310
Now the Jing made him their King,

459
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,280
isn't it god's will for us
to defeat them again?

460
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,550
Only if I cut off Tantai Jin's head,

461
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,830
will I not fail god's good plan.

462
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,760
Father, please think again.

463
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,440
What?

464
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Do you doubt my judgment?

465
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,310
Then why don't you replace me now

466
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,830
and sit upon my throne?

467
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,550
I dare not.

468
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,870
No more discussion.

469
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,070
I've decided.

470
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Pass down my order:

471
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,790
Send troops to Jing Kingdom!

472
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,680
Your Majesty,

474
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,000
[Chenming Hall]
Tantai Minglang's remnants are still out there.

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,920
Now Sheng Kingdom is invading our borders.

476
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,630
They're trying to destroy us

477
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,350
while you have
less control over the country.

478
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,720
Yes.

479
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,240
Your Majesty just came to power,

480
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,350
your ministers still have concerns

481
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,520
and your people still have doubts.

482
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,480
This is when we're the weakest.

483
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,070
That's right.

484
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
The Sheng is known for their strong troops

485
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,720
and battle-wise generals.

486
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,760
We can hardly
have the upper hand against them.

487
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,590
Why don't we retreat first

488
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,150
to a natural barrier
that's easy to defend?

489
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,720
This is the best strategy.

490
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,000
Minister Zhang's right!

491
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,870
He's absolutely right!

492
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,790
[Jing Kingdom is my homeland.]

493
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
[It's also where my mother's tribe lives.]

494
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,350
[This throne decides my fate.]

495
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,790
[As long as Jing Kingdom
thrive under my rule,]

496
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,520
[no doubt that
my power will be unparalleled.]

497
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,320
[And I can say goodbye to the fate of]

498
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
[slavishly dependent on others for good.]

499
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,800
I understand.

500
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,430
Your Majesty,

501
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,040
then where should we retreat to?

502
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,870
Now our kingdom is so weak.

503
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,180
How much territory can we defend?

504
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,800
Yeah.

505
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,000
If it's the late King,

506
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,720
we'd be retreating to the capital.

507
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,040
Retreating

508
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,350
isn't a good strategy.

509
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,670
Now the Emperor Sheng started this war.

510
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,320
Let's fight him with everything we got.

511
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,350
I will personally go lead on the borders.

512
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,240
This is not for defending our land,

513
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,390
nor for taking cities southward.

514
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,590
What I want is to take him by surprise

515
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,000
and defeat him with one blow.

516
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,000
Please reconsider!

517
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,720
We've arrived.

518
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,110
Farther ahead
is the barrier of Barren Abyss.

519
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't wanna get near it.

520
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,520
Thanks for walking me here.

521
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,720
Alright,

522
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,110
I've done what I promised you.

523
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,480
It's up to you whether you can get in.

524
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,350
We'll go separate ways from here.

525
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,590
Sister Fox,

526
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,830
thank you.

527
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,190
You can thank me

528
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,480
after you get out of there alive.

529
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,670
[I finally made it here.]

530
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,590
[Li Susu,]

531
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,720
[if you see the God of Cosmos,]

532
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,190
[you may be able to save
the Four Continents and Three Realms.]

533
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,760
Report!

534
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,110
Your Majesty,

535
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,480
as for what you've ordered previously,

536
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
the scouts have returned.

537
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,590
What have they found?

538
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,520
They haven't found the girl

539
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,000
you described along the road.

540
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,000
But farther south

541
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,670
will be the territory of Sheng Kingdom.

542
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,560
Keep searching.

543
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,830
She must be found, dead or alive.

544
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,870
How are we doing on the frontline?

545
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,870
Ye Xiao is quite valiant.

546
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,240
Their morale is high.

547
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,350
We have been defeated.

548
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,630
Call all generals here for a meeting.

549
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,480
Yes.

550
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,670
[Ye Xiao's elite soldiers
are good at fight.]

551
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,240
[If I can use a Firewing Army
consisting of demon creatures,]

552
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,110
[I may be able
to fight against heavy odds]

553
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,350
[and reduce casualties at the same time.]

554
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,220
[Ye Xiwu,]

555
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,260
[you'd better not die.]

556
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,980
[Wait for me to catch you back.]

557
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,040
[This is the Barren Abyss Barrier.]

558
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,870
[With my mortal body now,]

559
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,040
[I'm afraid
I can't take the barrier's power.]

560
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,280
[Oh right.]

561
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,390
[Maybe I can try to]

562
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,960
[control Chongyu with the power of]

563
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,830
[World-alluring Jade.]

564
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,280
Chongyu.

565
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,000
I can only take my chances.

566
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,670
[This feels exactly
like in the time array.]

567
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,520
[Susu.]

568
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,670
[Susu.]

569
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,150
Who are you?

570
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,670
Come to me.

571
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,280
Why do you know my name?

572
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,000
[Why is there a child here?]

573
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,910
Get away!

574
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,630
She's mine!

575
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,040
[They're too close to the child.]

576
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,560
[Using a charm
may hurt the child as well.]

577
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,320
Get away!

578
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,240
Another human!

579
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,960
We're so lucky today.

580
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,240
Come on, catch me if you can!

581
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,430
After her!

582
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,190
Go now!

583
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,670
After her!

584
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,670
[Li Susu.]

585
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
[This voice sounds like]

586
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,040
[that immortal lord
in the Mirror of the Past.]

587
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,590
Greetings, Senior.

588
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,000
Li Susu,

589
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,670
we meet again.

590
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,150
Are you waiting for me to come?

591
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,080
I am Ji Ze, the God of Cosmos.

592
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,590
The Light-breaking Array
and the Mirror of the Past

593
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,670
were both left by me.

594
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,800
I stayed here and held on
for ten thousand years.

595
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,630
Just to wait for your arrival.

596
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,480
I've found that person with evil origin.

597
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,040
But I still can't find a way

598
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,480
to destroy the evil bone.

599
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,040
Please enlighten me.

600
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,870
I can tell you how.

601
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,910
To destroy the evil bone,

602
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,910
you'll need three keys

603
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,720
to unlock the rules of karma,
stop what is destined to happen

604
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,280
and change everything.

605
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,040
What keys?

606
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,480
A dream.

607
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,520
A teardrop.

608
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,230
And a thread.

609
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,040
What dream?

610
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,440
This dream should be coming soon.

611
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,630
The teardrop is the first drop of tear

612
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,710
the Devil God shed for love.

613
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,560
It's called Soul-slaying Teardrop.

614
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,560
And what does "a thread" refer to?

615
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,520
The thread is connected to the teardrop.

616
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,580
If you can open Devil God's heart gate,

617
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,880
the Soul-slaying teardrop
will turn into nine spikes.

618
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,000
When you stab them into his heart,

619
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,520
you'll be able to destroy the evil bone.

620
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,920
But I'm barehanded.

621
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,190
I can only try my best.

622
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,520
I know it's difficult too.

623
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Sorry for putting you through this.

624
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,080
The time has come.

625
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,590
I'm about to fall.

626
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,880
Senior!

627
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,400
After I fall,

628
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,920
the Barren Abyss Barrier
can still hold for 300 days.

629
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,440
Within 300 days,

630
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,960
if you can't destroy the evil bone,

631
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,590
demons will be out of Barren Abyss.

632
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,590
Everything will be irrecoverable.

633
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,960
I understand.

634
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,480
I

635
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,440
can finally join my fellows.

636
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,310
The Mirror of the Past.

637
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,840
[The Mirror of the Past]

638
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,040
[was transformed from Ji Ze's divine eye.]

639
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,360
So he waited here

640
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,670
just for this.

641
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,790
[A dream, a teardrop,]

642
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,560
[and a thread.]

643
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,560
Luckily, protected by the divine power,

644
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,960
The foul energy didn't invade her deep.

645
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,710
Little girl.

646
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,960
Little girl.

647
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,310
You're awake.

648
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,000
Come.

649
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,630
[Could she be Jing Lan'an's daughter?]

650
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,710
Who… who are you?

651
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
I'm Ye Xiwu.

652
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,710
Just now

653
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,440
I ran into you down the cliff.

654
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,710
How are you feeling?

655
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,440
I remember I fell into a

656
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,480
hole that's very, very deep.

657
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,630
How did I get out?

658
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,560
Do you still remember who took you here?

659
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,230
It's a man with scars on his face.

660
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,630
He's quite mean.

661
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,150
Come.

662
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,920
[Scars on the face?]

663
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,790
[Should be Tantai Minglang.]

664
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,480
Come, let's go down the mountain first.

665
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,520
Little girl,

666
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,790
what's your name?

667
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,110
My name is Yue Fuya.

668
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,670
I'll take you downhill first.

669
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,400
Then we'll see what to do, alright?

670
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,590
Let's go.

671
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,560
Why is it suddenly so hot?

672
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,190
[I entered Barren Abyss in winter.]

673
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,000
[Why do the grasses
turn green so quickly?]

674
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,710
Hi, mister.

675
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,080
Could you tell me

676
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,360
what month it is now?

677
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,440
What month?

678
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,440
It's already April.

679
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,750
Miss,

680
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,880
how come you forgot which month you're in?

681
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,150
We went into the mountain to pick herbs

682
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,000
but were lost in the woods.

683
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,080
We spent quite some time there.

684
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:04,750
Miss,

685
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,880
you'd better not pick any herbs.

686
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,110
Just go home as soon as possible.

687
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,840
The world is in chaos now.

688
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,750
What happened?

689
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,230
Haven't you heard?

690
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,480
Since the new king ascended throne,

691
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,710
Sheng and Jing have been at war

692
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,080
for three or four months.

693
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,110
The new Emperor Jing?

694
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,190
Who is he?

695
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,230
I heard it's
the youngest son of the old king.

696
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,440
The one back from Sheng Kingdom.

697
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,630
[Tantai Jin.]

698
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,480
[He fought on the battlefield personally]

699
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,920
[by commanding demon creatures.]

700
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,960
[The Sheng army
suffered defeats one after another.]

701
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,150
[Their casualties are heavy.]

702
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,040
Welcome back, Your Majesty!

703
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,520
I heard General Ye fell off his horse

704
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,960
and still hasn't woken up.

705
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,310
Now General Ye's son is leading the army

706
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,440
[to defend the Jia Pass.]

707
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,100
[Jia Pass]

708
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,230
[Dad is on the brink of death.]

709
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,000
[Qingyu is also in a dangerous place.]

710
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,190
[Tantai Jin actually
became the Emperor Jing.]

711
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,400
Your Majesty,

712
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,080
none of the scouts sent out recently

713
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,300
have found the whereabouts of Miss Xiwu.

714
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,750
According to the prisons from the Sheng,

715
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,590
Miss Xiwu hasn't returned to the Sheng.

716
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,790
She's vanished.

717
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,110
It's my fault
for failing to finish the job.

718
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,590
Keep searching.

719
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,480
Leave no stones unturned.

720
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,610
Yes.

721
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,040
Baiyu,

722
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,560
how are we doing in Jia Pass?

723
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,790
I heard their provisions are running low.

724
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,190
Your Majesty,

725
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,560
according to spies,

726
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,110
the Emperor Sheng is prone to suspicion.

727
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,790
He's not satisfied
with Ye Xiao being injured.

728
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,080
This time, Ye Qingyu is only allowed

729
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,440
to attack and charge.

730
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,630
Their soldier's pay and provisions
are barely enough.

731
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,880
Deputy Liu,

732
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,920
how many provisions do we have?

733
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,840
We can't sustain three days, General.

734
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,630
The Jing invaders attack us every day.

735
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,080
We are running out of
provisions and medicine

736
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
very quickly.

737
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,080
A lot of our brothers
can't hold much longer.

738
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,880
[Your father lost three cities
and disgraced us all.]

739
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,110
[Too many provisions have been used.]

740
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,150
[Now the national treasury is empty.]

741
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,480
[You're responsible
for your own provisions.]

742
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,040
[If you lose the Jia Pass,]

743
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,230
[I shall execute your whole clan.]

744
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,040
give out the food to our men.

745
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,560
I'll think of a way tomorrow.

746
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,480
Yes.

747
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,270
Ye Qingyu is just

748
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,230
struggling to fight.

749
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,630
The foolish Emperor Sheng

750
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,190
actually has such a good general
to lead the army.

751
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,590
Have you hunted

752
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,000
any powerful demon creatures?

753
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,080
I heard there's a Heptatail Fox

754
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,440
in the nearby mountains.

755
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,110
I've sent hands to hunt.

756
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,360
But now we haven't got it yet.

757
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,110
Sorry to disappoint you.

758
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,000
[Seem like an acquaintance.]

759
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,040
It's fine.

760
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,190
I'll go personally.

761
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,400
How can you

762
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,310
catch me with these stupid tricks?

763
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,670
Oh no, she's getting away!

764
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,670
What a surprise

765
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,880
for today's demon hunt.

766
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,080
What a coincidence

767
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,790
to meet you again.

768
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,880
Move, and I'll cut off your tail.

769
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,750
Tantai Jin,

770
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,230
where's Ye Xiwu

771
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,150
who used to be with you?

772
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,710
You've seen her?

773
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,630
So you care for her.

774
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,920
I don't know where she went.

775
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,400
That's why I asked you.

776
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,840
I don't feel like killing you today.

777
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,750
You may be of some other use.

778
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,110
This is a secret drug of Yiyue tribe.

779
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,480
Eat it.

780
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,560
Be loyal to me. Work for me.

781
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,520
And you'll be safe.

782
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,040
But if you ever betray me,

783
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,270
you will endure the pain
of getting bitten by thousands of bugs.

784
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,270
Then you will explode and die.

785
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,590
So?

786
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,150
Are you gonna eat it

787
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,630
or…

788
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
Am I going to have another fox-fur robe?

789
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,190
Hold on.

790
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:12,960
I'll do it.

791
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,960
General,

792
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
there's a woman outside
who wants to see you.

793
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,110
She said she's your old friend.

794
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,840
Let her in.

795
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,190
Pian Ran?

796
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,480
Pian Ran.

797
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,230
It's been a long time.

798
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,560
I thought you already forgot me.

799
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,040
I thought back then you were already…

800
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,270
Why are you here?

801
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,480
You should go.

802
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,590
Tantai Jin
is hunting demon creatures outside.

803
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Be careful not to get caught.

804
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,880
It's too late.

805
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,150
By order of the Emperor Jing,

806
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,750
I'm here to ask you to surrender.

807
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,150
Just go.

808
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,590
I knew it would be like this.

809
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,150
Don't drive me away so fast.

810
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,960
Take this as catching up with me.

811
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,480
Jia Pass needs provisions urgently.

812
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,080
We can only sustain three days.

813
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,360
Please allocate provisions to us.

814
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,270
I shall do everything I can
to defend Jia Pass.

815
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,920
How many of these letters have you sent?

816
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,310
Has any provision come?

817
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,150
Emperor Sheng is such a shrewd person.

818
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,440
He wants you to fight without food.

819
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,520
Or shall I say,

820
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,630
he doesn't care about your lives at all?

821
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,440
He only cares

822
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
if this city is his or not.

823
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,750
Do you know how many
Firewing Army does Tantai Jin have?

824
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,880
Before I got out of there,
he gave his men an order.

825
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,080
If Jia Pass can't be conquered,

826
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,040
he'll lead the Firewing Army
and fight by himself.

827
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,520
By then,

828
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,440
how many people will die?

829
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,080
In this case,

830
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,480
go persuade Tantai Jin to kill less!

831
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,360
It's only because he didn't start the war

832
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,190
that I came to persuade you.

833
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,670
Ye Qingyu,

834
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,560
will there be peace
if Tantai Jin stops killing?

835
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,230
How naive of you.

836
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,190
This war was started by Emperor Sheng

837
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,520
simply because he's angry

838
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,630
to see the hostage prince
who once begged for his mercy

839
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,670
can now become a king.

840
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,080
You're not a foolish one.

841
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,710
You also know

842
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,110
your entire army
will perish with you if this goes on.

843
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,520
Emperor Sheng is too stupid

844
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,710
to even see this.

845
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,400
Instead of working for a stupid king,

846
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,190
why don't you follow a wise one

847
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,920
to keep your soldiers alive?

848
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,040
My family is the guardian of Sheng.

849
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,000
If I surrender,

850
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,630
how can I face my ancestors?

851
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,000
Ye Qingyu,

852
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,040
do you actually think

853
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,400
your reputation

854
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,230
is more important than the lives
of thousands of soldiers?

855
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,110
Enough talking.

856
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:01,710
Leave!

857
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,440
I'm just a fox.

858
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,400
How can I understand state affairs?

859
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,110
Tantai Jin is willing
to see you alone tomorrow.

860
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,480
If you really don't want to surrender,

861
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,710
[Stone carving, Mount Mituo, at 07:45.]
just kill him to end the war.

862
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,080
It's a great opportunity.

863
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,750
You actually came. One man, one sword.

864
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,590
You have some courage.

865
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,840
You're wrong about it.

866
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,790
I didn't carry a sword.

867
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,080
Just a few days apart,

868
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,840
you have become a king.

869
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,750
That's impressive.

870
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
The last time I saw you,

871
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,230
you were still as lively as a tiger.

872
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,110
Just a few days later,

873
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,480
you looked worn out.

874
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,000
If I kill you now,

875
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,840
or take you back alive,

876
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,040
my family will have
another military merit.

877
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,750
Then go ahead and try.

878
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,710
See if you'll get a promotion

879
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,000
or if your king will dread you

880
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,560
for being a threat to his throne.

881
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,880
That's irrelevant for now.

882
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
If I kill you today,

883
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,710
I would be killing
a malicious man for the world!

884
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,190
Ye Qingyu,

885
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,920
I've been a hostage in the Sheng for years.

886
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,310
We both know how paranoid

887
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,040
Emperor Sheng is.

888
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,110
The Ye family
is on the brink of destruction.

889
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,400
Be it punishment or reward,
I'll thank my king.

890
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,040
Our Ye family is and will be Sheng people.

891
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,440
I won't be incited
by a few words from you.

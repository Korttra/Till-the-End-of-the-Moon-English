there was a God of War.

His name was Ming Ye.

disliked the marriage at first,

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,120
he was drawn

into her step-by-step later.

75
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,800
Yet he didn't have time

76

She mistakenly thought
that he didn't love her.

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,750
[Since it couldn't be destroyed,]

171
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,200
[the only solution is to seal it]

172
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,790
[under the Water Mirror.]

173
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,390
[and subdue it here forever
with the help of divine power.]

174
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,870
Terrible.

175
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,270
Divine Platform has something wrong.

176
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,000
Qu, stand still.

177
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,150
Disciples above all have been back.

178
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,120
Perhaps they are making a deke.

179
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,790
Let's kill this devil first

180
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,150
and not be duped.

181
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,840
Stop, devil.

182
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,630
As long as I'm here,

183
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
you are not allowed
to take the Bone-refining Seal away.

184
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,480
[It's her.]

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,270
[Then I'm gonna take your life.]

186
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,390
[You can't act wildly]

187
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,750
[at the former divine residence.]

188
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,320
[Just you alone to stop me?]

189
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,720
[Even the twelve gods risk their life,]

190
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
[they can't stop His Lordship.]

191
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,030
[What do you count?]

192
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,320
[The Bone-refining Seal
and the Heart of the Devil God]

193
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,150
[will be returned to His Lordship finally.]

194
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,720
[You are born with the evil bone]

195
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,550
[and doom to be the Devil God.]

196
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,480
[You're the Devil God.]

197
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
[You're the biggest curse]

198
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,960
[in the world.]

199
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,640
[This is your destiny.]

200
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,070
[To be a devil or a divine]

201
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,350
[is up to a moment's thought of you.]

202
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,200
[Ming Ye.]

203
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,920
Why do you choose me
to step into your Bo're Life?

204
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,830
You find no chance

205
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,510
to take the Bone-refining Seal today.

206
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,920
A common disciple of the immortal

207
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,880
could actually seal the Bone-refining Seal.

208
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,200
Xiaoyao Sword-play,

209
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,880
Shatter!

210
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,000
No.

211
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,310
Something is wrong with Divine Platform.

212
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,790
Cang Jiumin.

213
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,310
[This is for…]

214
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,070
[Your Lordship.]

215
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,510
Cang Jiumin,

216
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,310
Don't be seduced by devil energy.

217
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,960
Wake up.

218
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,400
It's been five hundred years.

219
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,510
The demonic fetus has been found by me
in the end.

220
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,240
[It looks like they have found it.]

221
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,160
[The charm has been made in.]

222
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,960
[Devil God,]

223
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,270
[I guess you didn't expect that, right?]

224
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
[The ones unsealed me]

225
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,440
[are two of your most loyal men.]

226
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,750
[I have regained the freedom]

227
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,680
[that deprived by you.]

228
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,720
[Tantai Jin,]

229
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,750
[you are originally a demonic fetus.]

230
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,350
[How can you defy my will?]

231
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,200
[When the seal merges into your heart,]

232
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,790
[I…]

233
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,160
[am gonna wake up.]

234
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,270
Cang Jiumin.

235
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,070
Cang Jiumin.

236
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,000
Wake up!

237
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
Wake up!

238
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,400
No.

239
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,110
No way!

240
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,920
[It's His Lordship's power.]

241
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,790
Cang Jiumin.

242
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,720
Concentrate.

243
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't get carried away.

244
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,270
[His Lordship's plan is abstruse.]

245
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,920
[Today the situation is uncertain.]

246
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,590
[Better not get involved in it here.]

247
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,350
[I can come to pick His Lordship up
to go back to Barren Abyss]

248
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,550
[when the demonia fetus is wakened up.]

249
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,790
Ok, your Lordship.

250
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,350
The Bone-refining Seal originally is yours.

251
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,310
I'm leaving now.

252
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,830
[The devil energy is due to
the seal integrated with the heart.]

253
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,590
Cang Jiumin, Cang Jiumin.

254
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,070
Don't be bewitched by the demon artifact.
Wake up.

255
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,270
The Bone-refining Seal has connected
to your heart.

256
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,720
Do you wanna die?

257
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,270
Cang Jiumin,

258
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,720
Wake up.

259
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,960
Cang Jiumin.

260
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,270
Si Ying?

261
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,960
You come just at the right moment.

262
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,240
Let's kill all of them together today.

263
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,110
[Jing Mie,]

264
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,070
[No need to fight more.]

265
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,030
[Let's go.]

266
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,550
I didn't expect

267
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,750
they have fled.

268
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,400
[Could it be that someone leaked our plan?]

269
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,000
The immortal contest
has actually leaked out information.

270
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,640
The two demons took advantage of it.

271
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,680
It's my mistake.

272
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,750
To my surprise,
they came to Shangqing realm

273
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,720
to steal the devil artifact.

274
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,640
All right.

275
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
Qu, it's not your fault.

276
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,920
It's dark under the light.

277
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,310
Nobody expected the Bone-refining Seal

278
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,790
would hide in the Divine Platform.

279
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,310
Luckily, Jiumin and Susu

280
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,240
fought desperately
to have got back the demon seal.

281
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,920
Otherwise,
the consequences would be unimaginable.

282
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,310
Supposedly, the two devils

283
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,830
will come up with new tricks
as they couldn't snatch the seal.

284
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Master,

285
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,000
Something happens at the barrier
outside the gate of the realm.

286
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,720
Seems the devil tribe is invading us.

287
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,240
Who are you?

288
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,310
How dare you intrude on our immortal realm!

289
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,790
You all may leave.

290
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,200
Buddy,

291
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,510
long time no see.

292
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,680
Di Mian, you have been imprisoned by Demond God
for ten-thousand years.

293
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,400
Finally, you return today.

294
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,070
Congratulations!

295
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,350
The ten thousand years

296
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,200
all are just fleeting time.

297
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,510
I think your immortal dress

298
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,750
is perfect for you.

299
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,920
Why not stay here for a while?

300
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,680
Then you two can get together.

301
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
What do you ask

302
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,400
to see me for?

303
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,750
If you wanna know how Cang Jiumin's injury is,

304
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,480
I have handed him to Uncle Zhaoyou

305
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,160
as your instruction

306
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,310
for a good recuperate.

307
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,750
My dear.

308
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,680
[Susu.]

309
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,880
Who are you?

310
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,790
Come to me.

311
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,830
How come you know my name?

312
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,110
It's you.

313
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,880
Susu,

314
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,400
you two know each other.

315
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,070
I had been to Barren Abyss

316
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,270
and talked with him.

317
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,680
You fell in rashly at that time.

318
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,440
If I hadn't noticed you in time,

319
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,110
you would have been smashed to pieces.

320
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,440
I'm very grateful

321
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,960
for you saving my life.

322
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,350
It looks like you two

323
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,680
knew each other by fate.

324
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,440
Susu,

325
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,880
come here.

326
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,070
Get down on your knees
and kowtow to your father.

327
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,110
To repay him for giving you life.

328
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,200
No.

329
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,350
I'm her biological father.

330
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,510
But,

331
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,200
I haven't raised her for one day.

332
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,480
God has been nice to me

333
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,720
for us to reunite here.

334
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,110
Father?

335
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,270
Dad,

336
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,790
what's going on?

337
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,310
It's a long story.

338
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,510
During the devil slaying battle
ten thousand years ago,

339
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,480
Lord of Evil defected and badly hurt Devil God,

340
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,400
but was sealed in Barren Abyss by Devil God.

341
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,350
[Decades ago, I had an arduous struggle
with the evil cultivator.]

342
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,110
[I seriously hurt
and fell into Barren Abyss]

343
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,160
[and was almost devoured by devils.]

344
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,590
[Fortunately, I fell outside the gate
of Di Mian's cave.]

345
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,680
[He tried his best to cover me
with his devil power]

346
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,960
[and dispelled the devils.]

347
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,110
[That's how I got away with it.]

348
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,160
[In return for his saving my life,]

349
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,480
[I promised him to find]

350
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,920
[the spirit egg he had with his late wife, Chu Huang.]

351
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,350
I haven't seen it.

352
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,310
No.

353
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,480
I haven't heard of it.

354
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,590
Thanks.

355
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,270
[Fortunately, heaven will pay you off
for your persistence.]

356
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,200
[I found the spirit egg eventually.]

357
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,590
[It was hard to be hatched.]

358
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,510
[Then I put it on the Magic Well
of Sumeru Base]

359
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,000
[It was nourished
by the pure spirit of heaven and earth.]

360
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,070
[Later, there was life movement in the egg.]

361
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,480
[Then I cast its spirit into the world.]

362
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
It went through life cycles
and suffered constantly.

363
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,110
I hoped one day

364
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,360
it could find a chance to break the shell
and come out.

365
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,590
[She was born on the Magic well
of the Heaven Lake.]

366
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,880
and generated from the spirit
of heaven and earth.

367
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,960
So I named her Princess of Elegance.

368
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,400
When Chu Huang died back then,

369
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,710
her body became Chongyu Harp,

370
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,760
a precious treasure of the Hengyang Sect.

371
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,510
I gave Chongyu Harp to that baby

372
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,400
and hoped she could be protected

373
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,960
by her mother somehow.

374
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,360
Now I see that the one I met

375
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,710
is my mother.

376
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,630
Dad sent my spirit into the world

377
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,030
to suffer constantly.

378
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,800
That's why there was Ye Xiwu five years ago.

379
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,760
and she looks just like me.

380
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,110
Maybe

381
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,070
she is my lifelong evil soul.

382
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,110
My spirit should have been restored
after the trials of a lifetime,

383
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,480
but it was damaged
by the Lightning Punishment.

384
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,760
As a result,

385
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,230
after five hundred years,

386
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,030
my physical body would spontaneously
combust without any external flames

387
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,510
and rest for ten years on the Sumeru Base.

388
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,670
Only when the cataclysm ends

389
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,710
can I truly wake up.

390
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
That's what happened.

391
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,360
Susu,

392
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,070
I hid the truth from you for so long,

393
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,760
and you won't blame me, will you?

394
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
I...

395
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,710
Susu,

396
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,000
you don't have to force yourself.

397
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,110
It's understandable if you don't want to
accept me as your father

398
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,550
or even hate me.

399
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
I don't hate you.

400
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,590
I just don't know what to do.

401
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,280
That's fine.

402
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,280
No matter whether you accept me or not,

403
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,630
Chief Qu will always be your father.

404
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,280
The grace of upbringing

405
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,710
cannot be severed by anyone.

406
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,960
Alright,

407
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
no matter whether you are
willing to call me father or not,

408
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,550
we will

409
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,360
take care of you together.

410
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,110
Father.

411
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,110
Get up.

412
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,070
It's really strange to think about it.

413
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,400
My mother is from the Phoenix Clan,

414
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,840
but I was born afraid of
birds and chickens.

415
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,920
It seems that destiny is predetermined.

416
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,280
It turns out that I'm afraid of myself.

417
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,550
This is great.

418
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,880
Today, you two reunited,

419
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
and a major issue in my heart is resolved.

420
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,630
Right, Di Mian,

421
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,480
your identity is special,

422
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,920
so please temporarily reside in our sect.

423
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,670
When I find a suitable opportunity,

424
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,360
I will invite all sects
to explain this matter

425
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,360
and let you

426
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,110
reestablish yourself in the world
with honor and dignity.

427
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,920
Thank you.

428
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,480
Have you heard?

429
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,230
Today, who trespassed into our sect

430
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,280
is the Lord of Evil, Di Mian,

431
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,000
who commands thousands of demons.

432
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,480
Actually, you may not know,

433
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
but his wife is the Goddess of Space, Chu Huang.

434
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,230
He risked his life
to work for the Devil God

435
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,590
in order to search for the Devil's weakness.

436
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,880
Yes, it is said in the legend

437
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,320
that he is the one who
defeated and killed Devil God.

438
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,670
Yes, it seems that
he has been through a lot

439
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,110
and endured many hardships.

440
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,510
Finally, he was able to
restore his reputation and identity.

441
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,400
All factions of the immortal sect
should treat him kindly and with respect.

442
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,440
For sure.

443
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,320
He is the hero who killed Devil God!

444
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,150
When His Lordship's
Bone-refining Seal was broken,

445
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,590
Mo Nv's spirit was unexpectedly
gathered together.

446
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,760
Sister!

447
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,110
You're finally awake!

448
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,670
His Lordship saved you again!

449
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,440
Sister!

450
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,230
Sister!

451
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,880
I am Si Ying!

452
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,070
Si Ying?

453
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,150
Your spirit was damaged
ten thousand years ago,

454
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,840
and that's why His Lordship
sent you to reincarnate in the mortal realm.

455
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,760
Now that your spirit has been restored
and you have returned,

456
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,480
we can finally reunite.

457
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,960
Si Ying, my sister!

458
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,030
Sister!

459
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,670
Susu,

460
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,710
since you now know your true identity,

461
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,840
it is natural that you have answers

462
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,840
to the changes you have undergone

463
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,800
since emerging from seclusion.

464
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,320
The Phoenix Clan

465
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,800
has a natural affinity
for practicing the Heartless Way,

466
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,760
which is considered a shortcut to godhood.

467
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
However, it is ultimately up to you

468
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,710
to decide whether or not to pursue this path.

469
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,150
Dad,

470
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,280
knowing my origins

471
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,840
has strengthened my resolve
to pursue my destination.

472
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,440
My mother was slain by the Devil God,

473
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,110
and my father was imprisoned
by him as well.

474
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,480
Whether for personal or public reasons,

475
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,070
it is my mission to
fight against the Devil God.

476
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,510
If the Devil God were to
truly return to this world,

477
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,400
then only a true god would be able to

478
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,710
resist and oppose him
in the Four Continents and Three Realms.

479
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,030
It is quite a heavy burden

480
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,920
to place solely upon your shoulders.

481
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,550
It's...

482
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,000
Dad, rest assured.

483
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,630
I promise,

484
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,150
the day of the Devil God's return
will never come.

485
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,920
Although Tantai Jin's evil bone
has been extracted,

486
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,320
the identity of the demonic fetus
is still highly unusual.

487
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,230
It would be best

488
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,590
to inform them only after

489
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,840
I have truly destroyed the evil bone.

490
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,070
It's just that

491
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,320
my practice of the Heartless Way is too...

492
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,480
Cang, I wonder

493
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,710
what are you here for?

494
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,760
Indeed, I have come

495
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,150
to make a request of you today.

496
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,070
I'm all ears.

497
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,360
Actually,

498
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,760
I was born in Jing five hundred years ago.

499
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,280
When I was little,

500
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,510
I was loathed by my father

501
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,280
and bullied by others.

502
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,030
I had never felt the warmth of this world

503
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,590
until one day

504
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,400
someone came into my life.

505
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,280
At first,

506
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,800
she kept saying that she wanted to kill me,

507
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,440
but she saved me several times.

508
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,670
It was her who showed me

509
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,150
the joys

510
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,110
and warmth of life,

511
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,920
as well as the pains

512
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,110
and sorrows,

513
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,920
and all the beauty that comes with it.

514
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,670
Later,

515
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,030
she told me that she liked me.

516
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,030
I was so happy at that time.

517
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,360
If only time could freeze

518
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,030
at that moment forever,

519
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,110
it would be so perfect.

520
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,360
Who is that person?

521
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,320
Her name is Ye Xiwu.

522
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,000
Sadly,

523
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,280
I made an irreparable mistake

524
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and she died.

525
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,360
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

526
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,760
Please accept my condolences.

527
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,280
I originally wanted to

528
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,590
join her in death,

529
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,960
but someone told me

530
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,590
that there is a Nether River in this world

531
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,630
that converges the spirits
of the three realms.

532
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,110
In order to see her again,

533
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,510
I found the Nether River

534
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,960
and searched for her in it

535
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,400
for five hundred years.

536
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,360
Every day,

537
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,550
my bones were burned by the Ruo Water,

538
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,030
and the pain was unbearable.

539
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,280
Later on,

540
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,840
I couldn't feel the pain anymore

541
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,190
and didn't even feel like I was alive.

542
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,000
But I still could not find her spirit.

543
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,440
What happened then?

544
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,760
Until one day,

545
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,110
I felt like I was about to die.

546
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,440
Fortunately,

547
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,030
Immortal Zhaoyou saved me

548
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,760
and I became a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.

549
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,030
This is all of my experiences

550
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,190
over the past five hundred years.

551
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,630
Jiumin, why are you

552
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,400
telling me all these?

553
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,590
The Nether River

554
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,800
didn't help me find Ye Xiwu,

555
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,630
but I read about a Soul Gathering Array

556
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,960
which can help me find Ye Xiwu's spirit.

557
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,800
However, this array requires

558
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,400
the blood of a pure spirit body as a trigger.

559
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,190
Miss Li,

560
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,000
can you help me

561
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,070
find the one I love?

562
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,920
If I can really find her,

563
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,190
I am willing to give everything I have

564
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,070
to compensate her,

565
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,070
even if

566
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,670
she wants my life,

567
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,030
I will give it to her.

568
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,280
I can't help you.

569
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,230
Let the past be passed.

570
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,280
Since you've changed your name

571
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,230
and started over,

572
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,440
why not forget about her completely?

573
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,280
The Ye Xiwu in your heart

574
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,000
no longer exists.

575
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,630
No longer exists?

576
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,070
What do you mean by that?

577
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,480
You have the same face

578
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,230
and the same temperament.

579
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,550
Yuling,

580
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,880
you are Ye Xiwu,

581
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,000
why don't you admit it?

582
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,630
Do you know that

583
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,760
you don't even dare to look at me?

584
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,150
Have you heard of
Zhuangzi's Dream of the Butterfly?

585
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,630
What?

586
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,920
You can think of Ye Xiwu as that butterfly,

587
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,070
everything is like a dream

588
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,630
and when you wake up,

589
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,360
it should all be dispersed.

590
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,110
Dispersed...

591
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,150
How?

592
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,030
Five hundred years have passed,

593
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,630
and I have never forgotten her.

594
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,960
I have seen her smile,

595
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,000
seen her cry.

596
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,800
She has hugged me,

597
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,630
protected me.

598
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,710
She loved me,

599
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,920
and hated me.

600
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,480
Even if this is really just a dream,

601
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,480
if you abandon me in the dream,

602
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,110
how can I easily wake up?

603
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,440
I don't understand what you are saying.

604
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,960
I have woken up from my dream.

605
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,760
It has nothing to do with me

606
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,800
whether you wake up or not.

607
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,280
Tantai Jin,

608
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,440
if you really want to make amends,

609
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,400
then forget about the past

610
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,960

675
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,590
In this Immortal Sect Competition,

676
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,320
I gave you so many artifacts

677
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,150
to help you come out on top

678
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,670
and bring glory to our Glorious Glow Sect.

679
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,510
But you didn't seem

680
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,760
interested in winning,

681
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,190
and instead, why did you flirt with a girl?

682
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,320
You're really disappointing.

683
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,070
I'm injured too!

684
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,630
Dad,

685
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,840
you are not even helping me retaliate!

686
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,030
Helping you?

687
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,280
I am too ashamed to see anyone now.

688
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,590
When can you bring us glory

689
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,920
like Cang Jiumin

690
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,510
and Gongye Jiwu did?

691
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,030
I would like to be like them,

692
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,190
but I simply do not have
the same natural talents.

693
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,070
You always tell me to work hard,

694
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,360
but if you have the ability,
why don't you work hard

695
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,590
and create another kid like them?

696
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,630
Nonsense!

697
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,710
You!

698
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,480
Kneel here and reflect

699
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,840
for a full 24 hours!

700
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,800
Cang Jiumin,

701
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,400
just you wait!

702
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,960
Sooner or later

703
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,960
I will make you fall from grace.

704
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,960
So, you and Cang Jiumin
knew each other 500 years ago

705
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,150
and were a couple in the past life.

706
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,360
The reasons behind it are complicated,

707
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,320
and forgive me that I can't explain them.

708
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,070
In short,

709
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,480
Cang Jiumin was a part of the tribulation
in my past life 500 years ago.

710
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,030
No wonder you have been melancholic

711
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,360
ever since you came out of seclusion,

712
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,000
as if you have changed.

713
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,710
Jiwu,

714
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
I don't want to deceive you.

715
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,480
What happened between Tantai Jin and I

716
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,000
is now in the past.

717
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,840
But after reuniting with him,

718
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:00,590
I realized that

719
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,670
even if we can't continue our past relationship,

720
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:07,510
there is no room

721
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,710
in my heart for anyone else.

722
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,670
Susu,

723
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,030
you are telling me these just to...

724
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,760
Because if I continue to be indecisive,

725
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,150
it will only make me
feel more sorry towards you.

726
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:32,710
I understand now.

727
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:35,880
Susu,

728
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,550
you don't have to feel guilty.

729
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,110
It is because I was not thoughtful enough

730
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,280
and failed to realize it earlier,

731
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,550
that caused you
to suffer alone for a long time.

732
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,000
Although I am reluctant,

733
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,320
no matter what,

734
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,030
I hope you can find happiness

735
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,000
according to your own wishes.

736
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,550
Moving on from someone is indeed not easy.

737
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,400
Give me some time.

738
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,280
In the next few days,

739
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
I will ask my master for permission
to leave the sect to catch demons.

740
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,840
I hope that when I see you again,

741
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:21,840
I will be able to face you
with an open and calm heart,

742
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,320
and just be your elder sect brother.

743
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:28,360
Jiwu...

744
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,110
Have a good rest.

745
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:43,800
I should leave now.

746
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:53,960
I'm sorry, Jiwu.

747
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,190
Quick pain is better than long-suffering.

748
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:58,000
This is the best choice

749
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,590
for you and me.

750
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,630
if you really want to make amends,

751
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,110
then forget about the past

752
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,550
and be Cang Jiumin.

753
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:14,840
As for me,

754
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,190
I am Li Susu, daughter of Chief Qu.

755
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,150
Now that the Devil God is about to descend...

756
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I have decided to
cultivate the Heartless Way

757
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,880
for the rest of my life and eradicate evil
in order to uphold justice.

758
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,230
The Devil God again...

759
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,880
Once the demonic fetus
is born into this world

760
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:56,920
and the devil weapon recognizes its owner,

761
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,590
the Devil God will be resurrected

762
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,150
and the three realms
will face an disastrous destruction.

763
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,880
I heard that the recent battle of Barren Abyss

764
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,360
was because Si Ying and Jing Mie,
the two remnants of the Devil God,

765
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,440
lost the demonic fetus.

766
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,670
That's why they have been
causing trouble everywhere,

767
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,800
trying to find the demonic fetus
through the devil weapon.

768
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,240

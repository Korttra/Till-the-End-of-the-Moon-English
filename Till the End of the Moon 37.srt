[Till The End of The Moon]

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 37]

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,510
Cang Jiumin has gone back to the Barren Abyss.

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,230
Devil Palace has been activated.

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,350
It won't be long

21
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,710
before the Devil God returns.

22
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,310
None of this would have happened

23
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,920
if both the Hengyang and Xiaoyao Sects

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,510
hadn't shielded that evil being.

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,510
It's something unforgivable.

26
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,560
We are a leaderless group

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,310
in the face of a very powerful enemy.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:10,000
As the chief of the Chixiao Sect,
I'm happy to take on the leadership role.

29
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,560
All in favor?

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,910
Um…

31
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,120
You're absolutely right, Chief Cen.

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,030
The Great Medicine Valley
is at your service from here on.

33
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,590
The Resources Sect is with you too, Chief Cen.

34
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,280
Good.

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,400
Now, chiefs,

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,360
get back and gather your disciples at once.

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,470
I will lead you all
to the Barren Abyss in three days.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
We will take out Cang Jiumin!

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,960
See? They hate you to the bone.

40
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,710
There is no place for you in this world

41
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,840
other than Devil Palace.

42
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,800
Chief Qu was killed.

43
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,560
Susu is in danger.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,870
Why?

45
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,750
What are you thinking about right now?

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,840
Wonder who killed Qu Xuan Zi?

47
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,910
Only three were at the scene.

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,590
Qu is dead.

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,430
Li Susu is unconscious with serious injuries.

50
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,680
Only Di Mian knows the whole story.

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
All the sects are convinced that

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,080
you were hiding the Sky-Slashing Sword.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,470
That it was you who killed the chief.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,590
That you stole the evil bone
trapped inside Li Susu

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,120
and returned here.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
It was all you.

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,960
Why?

58
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,000
Take a guess.

59
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,910
To pin Chief Qu's

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
murder on me.

61
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,910
But why did you have to hurt Susu?

62
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,430
Well, that wasn't us.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,240
If we had known the bone was in her body,

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,430
we would've taken her too.

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,470
But it doesn't matter.

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,590
As long as we retrieve the bone

67
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,960
and fuse it to you,

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,710
His Lordship will be revived.

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
The Sky-Slashing Sword…

70
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,190
Di Mian killed Chief Qu with the sword

71
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,600
and then stole the bone.

72
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,600
You're smart.

73
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
Cang Jiumin,

74
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,240
my advice is to let go of the past

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,600
and move on.

76
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,070
You wanted to be good,

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,270
but what is meant to be

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,510
has found its way to you.

79
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,870
The people you care about,

80
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,270
the people you love,

81
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,270
they are all going to die because of you.

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,270
Still remember what His Lordship said?

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,240
Oh, you're pathetic.

84
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,630
He will join the immortal sect.

85
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,680
He'll mistakenly believe that
he's capable of overcoming evil with good.

86
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,390
And he will bask in the warmth of
friendships and emotional bonds,

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,600
only to realize it is all but a dream.

88
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,510
Susu has suffered terribly because of the bone.

89
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,390
Because of me.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Maybe Baiyu was right.

91
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,870
Stop.

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,510
What?

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I see it now.

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,390
I will not be

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,390
pushed around anymore.

96
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,310
You people keep telling me that

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,120
morphing into the Devil God is my calling.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,750
Fine, I will accept my fate.

99
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,510
I'm glad you came around to your senses.

100
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,310
With Qu Xuan Zi dead,

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Cang Jiumin gone,

102
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,600
and all the sects focusing their attention on

103
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,310
exterminating the devil fetus,

104
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm able to lay low

105
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,830
and take time to heal.

106
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,040
I've got luck on my side.

107
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,800
The evil bone has enormous power.

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,630
I can't fuse with it just yet,

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,430
or it could backfire.

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,630
Now that I have the bone
and the Sky-Slashing Sword,

111
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,360
I'll just have to

112
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,680
wait for the right time to retrieve

113
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,560
the Bone-refining Seal
and the God-slaughtering Crossbow.

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,430
Mr. Di Mian, Susu is awake.

115
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,040
She's heartbroken.

116
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,920
Would you please go check on her?

117
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,160
It would be greatly appreciated.

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,830
Right, I almost forgot about her.

119
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,830
Hopefully, she hasn't pieced it all together.

120
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,240
Susu.

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,950
Apologies, Father.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,720
You came to see me.

123
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,390
It should have been the other way around.

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,830
Don't worry about it.

125
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,270
You're still grieving

126
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,870
Chief Qu's death.

127
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,950
I won't judge you
for being too overwhelmed to visit me.

128
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,800
It's perfectly understandable.

129
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,000
You already know what happened, don't you?

130
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,310
I did a terrible job

131
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,430
of protecting--

132
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,240
I, too, was stabbed by him.

133
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,510
Father,

134
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,630
only you were there.

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,070
Can you tell me

136
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,920
what really happened?

137
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,680
We were very close to

138
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,160
completing the array.

139
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,390
We were drained.

140
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,630
That's when

141
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,270
Jiumin showed up out of nowhere.

142
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,240
I recognized his weapon.

143
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,870
The Devil God's Sky-Slashing Sword.

144
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,950
He attacked Chief Qu.

145
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,950
And right before I was knocked unconscious,

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,120
I saw him cast a spell on you

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,240
and walk off with something black.

148
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,870
The Bone-refining Seal wasn't
the first demonic weapon I'd come across.

149
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,720
There was also this crossbow.

150
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,510
And I have both fused into my body.

151
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,720
Jin told me himself

152
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,750
about the God-slaughtering Crossbow himself.

153
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,000
If he had had the Sky-Slashing Sword,

154
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,510
he would have told me, too.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
And if he did have the sword

156
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,360
and was truly determined to kill,

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,440
I don't think anyone could have survived it.

158
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,960
Are you absolutely sure

159
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,150
it was the Sky-Slashing Sword?

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,440
I was once a leader of demons.

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,630
I know the Sky-Slashing Sword when I see it.

162
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,750
I wish I were strong enough

163
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,320
to defend Chief Qu.

164
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,910
The helplessness reminds me of

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
my days back in the Demon Realm.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,720
The devil fetus is the root of the Devil God.

167
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,080
Nothing is going to change that.

168
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,840
I should have known he wasn't being authentic.

169
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,790
I made

170
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,840
a misjudgment.

171
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,910
Susu,

172
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,080
you must cut him out of your life

173
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,200
and move on.

174
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,390
Don't repeat my mistake.

175
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,240
It's getting late.

176
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,750
I should probably go.

177
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,270
Rest well, Susu.

178
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,870
This is the only way

179
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,320
to get to the truth.

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,320
Yaoguang, I want to see you.

181
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,630
This place looks even more lifeless

182
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,600
than it did 10,000 years ago.

183
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,030
And you know that how?

184
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,790
Are you questioning me?

185
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,000
Susu,

186
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,870
it's unsafe for you to be around Di Mian.

187
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,320
I have to do this to keep you safe.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,240
Are you two

189
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,440
all that I have?

190
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,270
What do you mean?

191
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,120
10,000 years ago, Di Mian changed sides

192
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,840
and worked against me
in league with the deities.

193
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,910
I want the evil bone returned.

194
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,670
And I want him to welcome me on his knees

195
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,030
in front of Devil Palace when I am restored.

196
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,600
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

197
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,440
Master,

198
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,000
our scouts posted outside
the Barren Abyss have reported back.

199
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,870
Jiumin is in the Abyss

200
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,750
How is he?

201
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,360
Si Ying and Jing Mie
were bowing and scraping to him,

202
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,630
as if they were serving him.

203
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Those were their exact words.

204
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,030
Don't tell anybody about this.

205
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,630
Jiumin must have had his reasons.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,270
But right now,

207
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,510
those short-sighted fools from the Chixiao Sect

208
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,960
are calling the shots around here.

209
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,750
We are the only ones

210
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,030
that trust Jiumin.

211
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,180
[Uncle Zhaoyou From Li Susu]

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,120
Oh, there's one more person.

213
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,390
Susu.

214
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,670
Father,

215
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,360
how is your recovery coming along?

216
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,910
Yaoguang told me that

217
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,480
you usually take care of your own injuries.

218
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,080
I know a thing or two about healing wounds.

219
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,360
I could examine yours.

220
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,120
I'm good.

221
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,720
I've been a demon for over 10,000 years.

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,030
My blood would contaminate you.

223
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,720
Well, I am your daughter.

224
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,550
I'll be fine.

225
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,440
I've lost one of my fathers.

226
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,790
All the more reason
to be there for you when you need me.

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,120
Are you sure you want to do this?

228
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,270
Yes.

229
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,360
Sure,

230
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,360
if you insist.

231
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,030
Come on in.

232
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,030
I'm just worried the nasty wound

233
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,790
will scare you.

234
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,120
Why? What is it

235
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,200
you're afraid of?

236
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,840
Susu,

237
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,870
10,000 years I've been alive.

238
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,630
Yet our time spent together

239
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,720
is less than a tenth
of your time spent with Chief Qu.

240
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,390
I feel so guilty.

241
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,510
He was a busy man.

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,480
I didn't always get his attention.

243
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,240
But he was noble and honest.

244
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,390
And he had a big heart.

245
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,270
Growing up

246
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,510
with such positive influences in my life,

247
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,480
it's truly the luckiest thing
to ever happen to me.

248
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,910
Yaoguang,

249
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,600
did you assess my father's wound?

250
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,550
Was he really stabbed by the Sky-Slashing Sword?

251
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,440
He said he's been a demon for over 10,000 years.

252
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,200
And that he would have
to heal himself with his own demonic energy.

253
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,240
So, no, I did not.

254
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,440
The cut…

255
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,120
It was done by Father.

256
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,390
Susu,

257
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,080
don't be scared.

258
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,270
They'll find you

259
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,200
soon enough.

260
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,960
Di Mian,

261
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,200
where do you think you're going?

262
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
So it was a ploy by you

263
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,790
and my daughter, huh?

264
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,630
That's right.

265
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,480
Di Mian,

266
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,270
you're not getting out of here today.

267
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,910
Hand over the evil bone!

268
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,360
You've found the Devil Palace?

269
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,390
Stop screwing around!

270
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,790
Hand the evil bone over,

271
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,670
and I'll grant you an easy death.

272
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
You think

273
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,720
you can get the evil bone?

274
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,480
Don't be stuck with this old fart.

275
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,600
Di Mian the bloody twit mustn't get away!

276
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,510
[Oh, damn!]

277
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,240
[Hardly has the old wound healed
when another follows.]

278
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,910
[No. They've found the Devil Palace.]

279
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,480
[I must take in the evil bone's power
right off the bat,]

280
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,270
[so that those two fools get nothing.]

281
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,480
Uncle Zhouyou!

282
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,550
Uncle Zhouyou.

283
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,270
Are you all right?

284
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,590
Here.

285
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,550
Susu.

286
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,000
Just now,

287
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,920
Si Ying and Jing Mie appeared.

288
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,960
They wanted to help out Di Mian?

289
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
They wanted the same things as us:

290
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,270
to seize Di Mian

291
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
and to take back the evil bone.

292
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,310
Since this failed attack,

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,640
Di Mian is certain to hasten
to consume the evil bone.

294
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,550
I'm afraid that'll be irrecoverable.

295
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,640
By the way, where is Jiwu?

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
He heard that Chief Cen

297
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,550
and company had started off,

298
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,440
so he summoned our fellows
to go after them.

299
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,000
Jiwu has been unsettled lately.

300
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,510
To hustle for the Barren Abyss

301
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,350
is nothing but to go to his death.

302
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,440
That's not an option.
Someone must stop him now.

303
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,200
Then I'll go to stop Jiwu right now.

304
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,750
Right. Let's split up.

305
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
I'll chase after Di Mian.

306
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,000
Welcome our Devil God back.

307
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,480
Welcome our Devil God back.

308
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,270
Welcome our Devil God back.

309
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,510
Welcome our Devil God back.

310
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,510
Welcome our Devil God back.

311
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,550
[My Lord, we hardly make it.]

312
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,000
[Di Mian the bloody twit got away.]

313
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,880
[Shall we send all the demons hunt him?]

314
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,000
[No.]

315
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,590
Instead, I'll call them all back.

316
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,070
I'll command all the demons and devils

317
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,640
and reinvigorate the Barren Abyss.

318
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,790
[Di Mian, together with the evil bone,
has left the immortal sects,]

319
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,680
[which has also kept Susu
free from the turmoil.]

320
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,270
[She should be safe now.]

321
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,510
[Master won't let Di Mian get away,
for sure.]

322
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,680
[The point is this pair of devils,
with the Barren Abyss.]

323
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,030
[If they get the evil bone back]

324
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,880
[and merge it into me…]

325
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,680
[I'll definitely not repeat]

326
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
[the advent of the Devil God.]

327
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,160
Oh! Tantai Jin has a screw loose.

328
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
You are my right-hand persons.

329
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,640
Go along with me into the palace.

330
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,680
[Demons are gathered.]

331
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,000
[Something serious might happen.]

332
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,350
[The cloak that
Chongyu Harp transforms into]

333
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,680
[can temporarily make me invisible
to common demons]

334
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,110
[so that I can get in the Barren Abyss.]

335
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,920
[Hope it's not late.]

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,350
That person is you.

503
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,030
Back when I was still a hostage prince,

504
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,510
I was plotted against by my brother.

505
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,110
I was injured and stranded.

506
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,960
It's you who risked your life to find me

507
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,640
[and helped me return to Jing Kingdom]

508
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,830
[and ascend the throne.]

509
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,200
[Later,]

510
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,200
when I lost all hope because of Ye Xiwu,

511
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,880
it's you again

512
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,680
[who risked your life]

513
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,510
-to save me from the big fire.
-Your Majesty!

514
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,880
Without you,

515
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,510
how can I still be alive today?

516
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,240
How can I manage

517
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,270
to find her again?

518
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,200
[I wouldn't take the credit.]

519
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
[It's the blessing]

520
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,680
[that you're born with, Master.]

521
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,000
Blessing?

522
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,030
I was born as devil fetus with the evil bone.

523
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,790
You call that a blessing?

524
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,920
In this vast Mount Changze,

525
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,440
there's no one else but you

526
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,440
who can drink with me now.

527
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,200
Who's sneaking around here?

528
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,790
Such a complex smell of blood.

529
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,590
I haven't tasted this in quite a while.

530
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,680
It really tastes a little special.

531
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,960
Loyalty, innocence,

532
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,440
recklessness,

533
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,590
and a bit of bitterness due to guilty.

534
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,270
So, are you here because of loyalty,

535
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,960
or guilty?

536
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,000
I come to save my Lord.

537
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,480
He sees me as a friend

538
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,440
but was betrayed by me.

539
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,640
I must take him away

540
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,550
even risking my life.

541
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,480
It's the rich tastes I love.

542
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,070
Then, as you wish!

543
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,230
You are a cunning man.

544
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,670
A thousand-year cultivation
is hard to get.

545
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,110
You set his free,

546
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,150
then I'll let you go.

547
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,920
You let me go?

548
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,280
I'll drain all your blood.

549
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,920
My Lord!

550
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,780
[Jin,]

551
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,800
[you can only be me.]

552
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,400
[That's the whole life
of the devil fetus.]

553
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,230
I said, let him go.

554
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,030
It tastes awful.

555
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Your blood can absorb our devil power.

556
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,920
Only Devil God can do this.

557
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,630
You are really Devil God.

558
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,150
Go.

559
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,000
But you're different from him.

560
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,960
Your blood is with a tiny little bit

561
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,320
of sweet taste
and a warm feeling of sunshine.

562
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,710
Just a tiny bit.

563
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,320
But I still can taste them.

564
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,880
What's that?

565
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,590
Go.

566
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,320
My Lord,

567
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,150
they're gonna play hardball with us.

568
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,400
As Si Ying and Jing Mie are not here,

569
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,190
you'd better run away quickly.

570
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,840
But they ask you to guard me.

571
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I shouldn't believe
what Si Ying and Jing Mie said

572
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,110
and decided for myself for you.

573
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,280
It's pointless to say this.

574
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,880
Let's manage to get away first.

575
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,280
Ok.

576
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,670
You save me behind the back
of Si Ying and Jing Mie.

577
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,480
They definitly will find out.

578
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,710
So, what are you gonna do?

579
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,280
At worst, I'll die.

580
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,920
What about the people of Yiyue tribe?

581
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,550
I can't just

582
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,710
watch them kill you

583
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,190
and I can't do anything.

584
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,280
So, this is your plan.

585
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
Put the whole clan at stake

586
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,760
for my own life.

587
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,000
I'll protect you to leave here,

588
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,590
then I shall go back
to find a way for them.

589
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,400
If I can't save them,

590
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,030
I'll die with them.

591
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,480
I'll help you to find the solution.

592
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,760
Thanks a lot, my Lord.

593
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,190
They're

594
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,360
from my clan as well.

595
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,760
Go.

596
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,760
Be careful. You're hurt.

597
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,400
Never mind.

598
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,070
We're almost arrived.
The exit is just ahead.

599
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,630
[You, a devil fetus, get me worried.]

600
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,360
[I can't let them know
that he's Nian Baiyu.]

601
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,550
My Lord, what are you doing?

602
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,320
Go to hell.

603
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,880
You wish to kick down the ladder

604
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,960
even you don't get away.

605
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,230
The one who betrays me will never

606
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,510
get the chance to live from me.

607
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,920
Besides, he is willing

608
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
to lead the way when got frightened by me.

609
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,150
Such a coward like him

610
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,230
are not gonna stay by my side.

611
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,230
I was wondering

612
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,150
if this guy garnered his courage today.

613
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,550
Because he is obey

614
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,760
in every way for me for a long time.

615
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,760
It's you. You ruined a good stooge of me.

616
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,710
I'm sorry then.

617
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,670
How exactly did you get out?

618
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,760
Then the whole Demon Realm
is my residence.

619
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,190
And all devils are my subjects.

620
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,190
ou want to trap me with this.

621
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,000
Isn't it funny?

622
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,800
Si Ying spared your life

623
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,880
for the sake of the Lord,

624
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,320
while you ruin my plan repeatly.

625
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,800
Now, Si Ying isn't here.

626
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,400
so you may die with a whole body.

627
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
That'll be good end for you.

628
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,480
Go.

629
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,710
You killed many of our devils.

630
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,000
Now they will

631
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,280
take revenge on you.

632
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,070
Drain him.

633
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,840
Cang Jiumin,

634
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,280
you shouldn't be spared.

635
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,670
[Good.]

636
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,110
[Finnaly, you use the force and skill
of the Devil Tribe. ]

637
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,360
[That's what the Devil God
should be like.]

638
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,360
[I need to get out of here in a hurry.]

639
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,110
What a pity. He's just a husk after all.

640
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,030
Why don't we just kill him?

641
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,960
What's the hurry?

642
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,840
We haven't got the evil bone yet.

643
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,840
Let's go.

644
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,630
Let's pick that boy back.

645
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,110
Come out now and beg for mercy!

646
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,230
Don't waste my time.

647
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,880
Otherwise,

648
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,710
I'll break all your bones when I catch you.

649
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,400
Come out!

650
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,110
[How should I escape?]

651
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,800
[From the traces left by the demonic energy,]

652
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,190
[Di Mian may have absorbed the evil bone.]

653
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,630
[If he returns to the Devil Palace with it,]

654
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,280
[everything will be irrecoverable.]

655
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,710
Come out!

656
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,590
Give me power.

657
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,070
His Highness? It's His Highness's voice!

658
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,760
It's Di Mian.

659
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,150
This is

660
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,110
the smell of the evil bone.

661
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,800
Help me!

662
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,000
The devil energy is surging.

663
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,800
Did he swallow the evil bone?

664
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,480
Run!

665
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,230
Jing Mie!

666
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,000
Not enough.

667
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,150
Jing Mie!

668
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,800
Go!

669
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
It's the evil bone.

670
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,960
The evil bone is absorbing the energy.

671
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,110
Get out of here!

672
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:31,920
My Lord!

673
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,110
Si Ying,

674
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,880
I still need strength for my resurrection.

675
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,590
This is the Devil God's voice.

676
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,590
Di Mian is controlled by the Devil God.

677
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:46,510
My Lord…

678
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,110
Si Ying,

679
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,070
are you not willing to be sacrificed to me?

680
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,840
Since the day you brought me back,

681
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,960
I have made the decision

682
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,880
to live for My Lord,

683
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,760
and die for My Lord

684
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,360
forever and ever.

685
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,880
My Lord, wait for me.

686
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,630
From now on,

687
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,840
I am a part of you, My Lord.

688
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,000
Si Ying!

689
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,070
Di Mian now is carrying the evil bone,

690
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,000
and no one can stop him at all.

691
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,960
Is he going to the Devil Palace?

692
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,550
Is he going to start the All-in-Distress Way?

693
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,710
This is too dangerous.

694
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,190
No.

695
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,510
I have to figure out a way
to inform the immortal sect immediately.

696
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,030
What should I do? It would take
way too long walking like this.

697
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,320
This is the warning bell set by the Master.

698
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,510
Using devil energy to trigger
the Stone Inscription Array,

699
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,480
the Immortal Sect will notice immediately.

700
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,320
This is the fastest way.

701
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:22,070
Come on!

702
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,880
Send the alert now!

703
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,110
That's great!

704
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,030
It's from the warning bell
by the Barren Abyss!

705
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,960
There is devil energy that triggered the array.

706
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,320
Tantai Jin!

707
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,880
We finally got you.

708
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,920
The devil fetus has showed up.

709
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,150
The evil bone should not have
fused with him yet.

710
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,070
Everyone, start the form with me now!

711
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,630
The Subdueing Devil Form!

712
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,440
Brother Gongye…

713
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,400
I mean Chief Gongye,

714
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,360
I am willing to lead
the disciples of Xiaoyao Sect

715
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,670
to capture Cang Jiumin alive.

716
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,030
Chief Gongye!

717
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:00,630
Not allowed.

718
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,440
He is Tantai Jin,

719
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,320
who was born as the devil fetus.

720
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,630
He killed Master and stole the evil bone.

721
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,230
He is not the Cang Jiumin you know anymore.

722
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,630
Even today,

723
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,320
you still feel pity for the devil fetus.

724
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,280
If it weren't for your womanly mercy,

725
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:18,920
how could the sects of the four continents

726
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,230
be forced into such a predicament?

727
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,190
Why?

728
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,400
Where are they?

729
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,110
Chief Cen is right.

730
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,360
We can't make the same mistake again.

731
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,710
The Immortal Sect can no longer
be soft-hearted towards him,

732
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,670
otherwise the next victim sacrificed

733
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,670
would be other sect's fellows.

734
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,800
Enough said.

735
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,710
This is the right time
to kill the devil fetus.

736
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:57,710
Tantai Jin,

737
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,550
you won't get away this time!

738
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,400
Why is no one coming here?

739
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,230
Go stop Di Mian,

740
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,960
or it will be too late!

741
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,710
Chief Cen's attack is lethal!

742
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,880
I want him to die

743
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,510
and burn to the ground,

744
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,920
to avenge my son's death.

745
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,360
Go stop Di Mian!

746
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,960
Don't let him start the All-in-Distress Way!

747
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,190
Chief Gongye,

748
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,000
you had a good private relationship
with Jiumin.

749
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,670
How can you bear to do this…

750
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,320
Cang Jiumin never existed.

751
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,760
He has been the devil fetus
from the beginning to end.

752
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,880
He joined our immortal sect

753
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,320
juet to take away the evil bone.

754
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,320
Kill him. Kill the devil fetus!

755
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,710
Tantai Jin,

756
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,440
I want you to pay for Master's life!

757
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,510
Why?

758
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,760
Why is no one coming?

759
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,480
Why?

760
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,110
I can't believe he got away!

761
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,280
He can't run.

762
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,920
The disciples of the Hengyang Sect,
follow my order!

763
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,840
Follow me into the Barren Abyss to hunt.

764
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
If you see Tantai Jin,

765
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,710
kill on sight.

766
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,000
Let's go.

767
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,840
Get up.

768
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,110
Open it for me.

769
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
Open the door!

770
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,590
Start the All-in-Distress Way!

771
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,760
My plan will be fulfilled after this one step.

772
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,150
Si Ying!

773
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,840
Si Ying!

774
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,590
Who killed you?

775
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,030
Si Ying,

776
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,190
wait for me.

777
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,840
In the blink of an eye,
ten thousand years have passed.

778
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,630
The evil bone has finally returned here.

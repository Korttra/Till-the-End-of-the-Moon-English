00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,080
It's edible.

172
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,030
See?

173
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,080
Stop crying.

174
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,960
There.

175
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,320
Don't cry.

176
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,670
Kneel!

177
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,790
Just kneel!

178
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,790
Today I'm gonna let him

179
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,270
be our puppy dog. How about that?

180
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,750
Yeah!

181
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,870
-Bark!
-Bark!

182
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,200
-Come on.
-Bark!

183
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
-Come on.
-Bark!

184
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,670
Do it!

185
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,840
Bark!

186
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,910
Come on and bark!

187
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,440
-Bark!
-Come on!

188
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Puppy!

189
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,320
These little brats!

190
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,030
Come on!

191
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,080
Give it to him.

192
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,150
You can't kneel to those servants.

193
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,750
Let alone bark like a dog, understand?

194
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,200
They said if I barked,

195
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,510
they wouldn't beat me.

196
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,030
And even give me food.

197
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,320
Don't you know what dignity is?

198
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,550
Are you born without a sense of shame?

199
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,910
[As a prince, you're bullied by servants.]

200
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,750
[Do you have no sense of shame at all?]

201
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,240
[Sense of shame?]

202
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,150
[That means nothing to me.]

203
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,720
[Food is clearly more important.]

204
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,670
They keep bullying you like this.

205
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Don't you feel sad?

206
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,910
What's sense of shame?

207
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
What's feeling sad?

208
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,390
They're making fun of you.

209
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,510
Did they not mean to give me food?

210
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,150
No.

211
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,840
I see.

212
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
Then can I kill them?

213
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
[So this is the nature of Devil God?]

214
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,080
I can't take this anymore.

215
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,870
His Highness isn't normal at all!

216
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,670
He's a monster!

217
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,510
He's only six. He's still a child.

219
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
You think he's abnormal

220
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,630
simply because

221
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,270
he has been living in the cold palace

222
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,600
and is constantly bullied.

223
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,440
Understand?

224
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,670
But…

225
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,630
We're running out of money and jewelry.

226
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,150
We can't sustain like this.

227
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,120
Here's an idea.

228
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,150
A few days from now
is the palace maids' off-day.

229
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,200
I'll try to slip out

230
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,670
and ask for help from Yiyue Tribe.

231
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,630
What about me?

232
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,440
Yingxin,

233
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
I need you

234
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,390
to take care of him alone for a while.

235
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,790
His Highness inherited

236
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,120
the ability to communicate with animals.

237
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,000
He's the hope of Yiyue Tribe.

238
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,600
We must save him!

239
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,750
[Don't worry.]

240
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,870
[I'll be back soon.]

241
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,670
[I'll do my best
to bring you and His Highness]

242
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,870
[to Yiyue Tribe soon.]

243
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,910
[Trust me.]

244
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,150
Does it hurt?

245
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,960
Thanks for caring, Your Highness.

246
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,390
I'm used to it.

247
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,870
Where is Tantai Jin?

248
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,360
Come quickly to hear your edict!

249
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,320
It must be Lan'an coming to save us!

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,910
His Highness is here!

251
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,390
Edict from His Majesty:

252
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,720
Tantai Jin is to set off immediately

253
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,840
to be a hostage in Sheng.

254
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,670
What do you mean a hostage in Sheng?

255
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,550
You're asking that?

256
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
We lost the battle with Sheng Kingdom.

257
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
To make peace,

258
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,120
His Majesty ordered Tantai Jin
to be a hostage in Sheng Kingdom.

259
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
He shall set off today.

260
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,120
Understand?

261
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,270
You two help them pack things up.

262
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,670
-Yes.
-Yes.

263
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,790
Jing Lan'an, you liar!

264
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
You left me here to die!

265
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Liar!

266
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,840
Liar!

267
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,080
Liar!

268
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,630
[We're at Sheng Kingdom now.]

269
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,360
Chief Wu.

270
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,270
You're called Yue Yingxin?

271
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,360
You're the maid who came along
with the hostage prince?

272
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,510
Are you sending snacks to him?

273
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not gonna eat you.

274
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,320
Get in there.

275
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes.

276
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,030
[This old turtle is so disgusting!]

277
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,870
Your Highness!

278
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,960
Hold down this lowly maid, too!

279
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,440
What are you doing?

280
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,440
Let go of me!

281
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,550
Your Highness!

282
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,510
Your Highness!

283
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,550
Your Highness!

284
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,320
They say you're a freak.

285
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,440
You don't shed tears.

286
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,320
I don't believe there's someone

287
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,550
who doesn't shed tears.

288
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,720
Cry for me now.

289
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,670
And I'll let you go.

290
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,150
I really can't.

291
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,600
Your Highness!

292
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,400
How's that? Does it hurt?

293
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,510
The hostage prince still isn't crying.

294
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,510
Don't stop!

295
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,440
Go ahead and break his other arm off!

296
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,350
Yes.

297
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,240
Stop!

298
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,830
Greetings, Prince Lin.

299
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,350
You may all rise.

300
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,680
Brother,

301
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,030
Prince Tantai left his home country

302
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,640
to be a guest in our kingdom.

303
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
He did it for the peace
of the two kingdoms.

304
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,200
And also for keeping the civilians

305
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,110
free from the pains of war.

306
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,750
We should treat him politely.

307
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
How can you bully him without scruple?

308
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,070
Such a bummer.

309
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,200
Let's go!

310
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,790
Your Highness.

311
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,270
Thank you Prince Lin for saving us.

312
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,830
No need.

313
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,000
My fifth brother was being rude.

314
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,790
Prince Tantai looks pale.

315
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,070
Why don't you go back and have a rest?

316
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,680
I'll explain it to the teacher for you.

317
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,920
Come on. Thank you, Prince Lin!

318
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,590
Why would that Prince Lin

319
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,960
tell his brother to stop?

320
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,590
And how could he make them fear him?

321
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,200
I heard,

322
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
Prince Lin's mother is the queen.

323
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,400
She's also His Majesty's favorite.

324
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,920
People in the palace
are mostly superficial.

325
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,720
So naturally they dare not offend him.

326
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,160
Mother?

327
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,270
If he didn't have a mother anymore,

328
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,200
would he be the same as me?

329
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,400
Actually, what I said
isn't necessarily right.

330
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,240
Besides his mother
is important and favored,

331
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,550
Prince Lin is also gentle and intelligent.

332
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,270
Who wouldn't like him?

333
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,030
Really?

334
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,310
[If I behaved like him,]

335
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,640
[will others like me too]

336
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,030
[and stop bullying me?]

337
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,220
[Geography of Four Continents]

338
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,550
Geography of Four Continents?

339
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,400
Your Highness, why are you reading this?

340
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,680
It is said that Xiao Lin
just went to Mount Buzhao

341
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,350
where he'll cultivate for three years.

342
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,550
I don't know that place.

343
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,550
So I wanted to find it in books.

344
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,110
Someone can't even get out of the palace,

345
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,070
but is still dreaming about

346
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,960
some immortal mountain.

347
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,480
Trying to learn spells to fly out of here?

348
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,590
Prince Liang.

349
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,550
Take this!

350
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,200
Your Highness!

351
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,240
Are you alright?

352
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,110
Prince Liang,

353
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,240
why did you hit me?

354
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,070
Why?

355
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Because your smile looks disgusting.

356
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,920
I tell you what,

357
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,310
I've had enough of a freak like you!

358
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,310
Now that Xiao Lin's not around,

359
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,790
let's see who will protect you!

360
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,720
Get him!

361
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,640
Your Highness!

362
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,310
Stop it!

363
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,750
Stop!

364
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,160
Your Highness!

365
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
I thought

366
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,200
they stopped bullying me all these years

367
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,790
because I acted like Xiao Lin

368
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,550
and learned to be a normal person
like Lan'an said before she left.

369
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,070
But I didn't know

370
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,750
they were just scared of Xiao Lin.

371
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,590
Prince Lin,

372
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,830
congrats for completing your training

373
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,750
and moving into your new mansion!

374
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Good things come in pairs!

375
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,880
Congrats!

376
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,310
Congrats!

377
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,310
[Prince Tantai?]

378
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
We haven't met for three years.

379
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,030
Thank you for coming today.

380
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,110
Congratulations.

381
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Look! Miss Ye Bingchang is here!

382
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,110
That is…

383
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,830
She's the daughter of General Ye.

384
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,160
Miss Ye.

385
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,590
Your Highness.

386
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
It's getting chilly.

387
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,550
Be careful not to catch a cold.

388
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

389
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,310
Hos…

390
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,510
Prince Tantai, why are you here?

391
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,680
Miss Ye.

392
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,720
The weather is chilly.
Be careful not to catch a cold.

393
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,920
Your Highness, I don't feel cold.

394
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,640
Please keep the cloak for yourself.

395
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,110
[Could Tantai Jin like Ye Bingchang]

396
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,680
[because he was imitating Xiao Lin?]

397
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,240
Yingxin,

398
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,270
is it because my cloak is worn out?

399
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,070
Tantai Jin!

400
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,510
Who are you trying to disgust this time?

401
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,480
Prince Liang,

402
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
so many people pass by this corridor.

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,680
If you plan on beating me up here,

404
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,440
I'm afraid…

405
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,550
You haven't heard?

406
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,790
Now Sheng and Jing kingdoms are at war.

407
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,160
If I kicked your Jing ass,

408
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,480
who's gonna stop me?

409
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,440
Get him!

410
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,350
Your Highness!

411
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,400
Take that!

412
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,200
Your Highness!

413
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,270
Stop it!

414
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,590
[He's been getting beaten so frequently.]

415
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,240
[When does this ever end?]

416
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,000
Yingxin,

417
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,680
how does it feel like to be liked?

418
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,110
You're not answering.

419
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,030
Is it because you don't like me either?

420
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,200
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

421
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,720
I never disliked you.

422
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,830
When I was little,

423
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,440
I couldn't understand what the looks

424
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,200
on people's faces meant.

425
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,200
But now,

426
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,000
I sort of understand a little.

427
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,110
Actually, you've always resented me.

428
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,400
It's because of me

429
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,510
that you're trapped in this

430
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,200
dark and remote palace.

431
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,590
Yingxin,

432
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,830
I don't blame you.

433
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,720
I resent myself too.

434
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,070
I know people out there don't like me.

435
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,720
Normally speaking,

436
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,880
I should feel sad inside.

437
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,440
If it were Xiao Lin,

438
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,030
he'd be ridden with such guilt
that he couldn't eat.

439
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,480
Later on, I started imitating Xiao Lin.

440
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,200
I imitated everything he did,

441
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,160
hoping that I could

442
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,680
gradually become him.

443
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,640
Be someone likable

444
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
just like Xiao Lin.

445
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,510
But Yingxin,

446
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,750
I still couldn't feel a thing.

447
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,200
I was faking it when I smiled like him.

448
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,590
I was faking it
when I was being magnanimous.

449
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,550
I was even

450
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,590
faking it when I cared about others.

451
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,880
Fake things

452
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,270
deserve to be detested.

453
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,270
To be loathed.

454
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,920
And to be abandoned.

455
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,480
[Doesn't matter.]

456
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,550
[For someone like me,]

457
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,750
[being alive is a blessing enough.]

458
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,400
Your Highness.

459
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,070
[Why should I want love?]
Your Highness!

460
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,590
[Born with an evil bone…]

461
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,110
[Having no emotions or love…]

462
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,680
[None of it was what he wanted.]

463
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
[Nor was it his fault.]

464
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,510
[But once he became the Devil God,]

465
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,790
[all those victims]

466
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,920
[were indeed slain by him.]

467
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,550
I was ordered to send
a verbal message from Jing.

468
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,440
Jing Kingdom?

469
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,030
The hostage prince will soon marry

470
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,270
and leave the Palace of Sheng.

471
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,000
But once he does,

472
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,750
he might return to Jing Kingdom.

473
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,310
Once he returns,

474
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,920
he'll probably grasp power,

475
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,030
and then he'll become untouchable.

476
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,550
That's why Prince Minglang said

477
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,790
the hostage prince should
better not leave forever.

478
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,790
[Tantai Minglang?]

479
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,960
[Little Devil God's elder brother.]

480
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,480
Tantai Minglang wants me to kill him?

481
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,790
Then what's in it for me?

482
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,720
Even displaced horses
and birds miss their home.

483
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,270
Prince Minglang knows
that you're getting older.

484
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,310
As long as you're willing to help us.

485
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,920
We'll think of a way

486
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,440
to help you get out of the palace,

487
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,960
and return to your hometown.

488
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,030
Really?

489
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,590
You've sacrificed your best years

490
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,310
and ruined most of your life

491
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,920
just for Tantai Jin.

492
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,920
Are you really willing
to follow this monster

493
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,070
until you die in a foreign land?

494
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,550
Yingxin,

495
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,790
don't get seduced!

496
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,030
You watched Tantai Jin grow up.

497
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,790
Although he's weird,

498
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,110
he never once hurt you.

499
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,510
Do you really have the heart to do this?

500
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,790
He has no family
or friends in Sheng Kingdom.

501
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,270
You're the only person he can trust.

502
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,270
You can't betray him!

503
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,790
Yingxin!

504
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,000
Yingxin!

505
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,550
Okay. I'll do it.

506
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,790
Very well, then. I'll leave for now.

507
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,440
Even you betrayed him.

508
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,270
[In Tantai Jin's whole life,]

509
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,880
[if only there was someone
who truly loved him,]

510
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,030
[and held his reins,]

511
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,510
[maybe…]

512
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,480
[he wouldn't have
been forced to devilize.]

513
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,960
It's finally over.

514
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,680
We've finally found it.

515
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,960
The demon's den is protected by a barrier.

516
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,750
Bingchang's probably here.

517
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,640
I feel Tantai Jin and Miss Xiwu

518
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,920
are imprisoned here, too.

519
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,590
We have to rescue them fast.

520
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,160
Go check the borders of this barrier.

521
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,680
Have someone guard the roads.

522
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,750
Yes.

523
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,640
Hurry!

524
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,480
Move!

525
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,240
Now we must lure the demon out.

526
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,310
I'll do it.

527
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,110
Demon!

528
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,310
We've found your den!

529
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,160
Stop hiding!

530
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,480
Otherwise, I'll set your woods on fire!

531
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,440
Free delivery to my doorstep, eh?

532
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,310
[I wonder how Yingxin went crazy after.]

533
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,310
[Tantai Jin.]

534
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,680
Tantai Jin!

535
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,750
Tantai Jin!

536
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,960
Tantai Jin, wake up!

537
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,680
Tantai Jin!

538
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,830
You said you couldn't dream.

539
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,750
But why is there a nightmare blossom
sprouting from you?

540
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,310
Tantai Jin!

541
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,000
Tantai Jin, wake up!

542
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,310
Tantai Jin!

543
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,400
[Tantai Jin!]

544
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,680
[Tantai Jin!]

545
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,590
[Tantai Jin, wake up!]

546
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,070
I heard

547
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,400
among the outer disciples of Xiaoyao Sect

548
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,640
Jin is one of the best.

549
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,510
And his talents are extraordinary.

550
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,110
He's just doing it for fun.

551
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,680
What?

552
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,510
Do you really want Jin to be immortal?

553
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,510
Let me look at you, dear.

554
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,110
You've really gotten thinner

555
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,590
after you left the palace.

556
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,480
Mother.

557
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,750
Come.

558
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,750
I have something to tell you, Son.

559
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,400
While you were away cultivation,

560
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,270
I've been arranging you a marriage.

561
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,880
Thank you, Father.

562
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,550
The bride is the daughter of
Sheng Kingdom's General Ye Xiao.

563
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,110
Conflicts can never seem to cease
between Sheng and Jing.

564
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,400
After we make peace this time,

565
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,350
we will be more like friends than enemies.

566
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,510
I'll do what as you wish, Father, Mother.

567
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:34,880
Jin,

568
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,030
while you were cultivating
in Xiaoyao Sect,

569
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,790
did you meet any promising young talents?

570
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,510
The Prince Lin of Sheng Kingdom

571
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,200
got along well with me.

572
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,270
[What a coincidence.]

573
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,110
[Xiao Lin happens to be one
escorting the bride to Jing Kingdom.]

574
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,160
[You can spend time
getting to know him better.]

575
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,110
[Yes.]

576
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,750
Congratulations, Your Highness!

577
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,720
[I didn't want to]

578
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,830
[choose your wife so hastily.]

579
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,110
Congratulations, Your Highness!

580
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,400
[But now that you've
been throned Crown Prince.]

581
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640
[Your marriage
concerns the kingdom's future.]

582
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,880
Congratulations, Your Highness.

583
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,880
[Miss Ye Bingchang is well-educated.]

584
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,510
[She's also a stunning beauty.]

585
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,790
[I think you'll like her, my son.]

586
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,200
Ye Xiwu?

587
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,480
It's you?

588
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,440
Who else

589
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,000
were you expecting?

590
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,030
Mother?

591
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,480
Mother!

592
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,440
Father.

593
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,400
You matricide bastard!

594
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:53,880
No.

595
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,360
Father.

596
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,110
I didn't kill mother!

597
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,320
Lan'an.

598
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,670
Don't go.

599
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,480
[You're a monster.]

600
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,630
Don't go.

601
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
In your beautiful dream,

602
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,190
you had such a perfect family.

603
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,190
How did it feel to be loved by everybody?

604
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,960
Xiao Lin,

605
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,110
help me!

606
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,000
But that's all fake.

607
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,110
Once you wake up from these dreams,

608
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,880
no one will care about you,

609
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,800
nor will anyone love you.

610
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
All this time,

611
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,920
you've been imitating me,

612
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,800
hoping you could be like me,

613
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,670
to be ackowledged by others.

614
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,440
But in your dream just now

615
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,550
you got everything you ever wanted.

616
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,510
Love from your parents.

617
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,000
Easily ascending to the throne.

618
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,800
Even I'd envy that kind of life.

619
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,800
But can you really feel happiness?

620
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,510
I can't.

621
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,920
I felt nothing.

622
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
If not for you,

623
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,230
your mother wouldn't have died.

624
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,880
Your father wouldn't suffer
the loss of his love.

625
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,030
Lan'an wouldn't waste away
in that dark palace.

626
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,760
Yingxin wouldn't be shamed
time and time again.

627
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,670
They were all your nearest and dearest.

628
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,760
But they all hate you.

629
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,000
I never intended to do them harm.

630
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,030
Never.

631
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,840
See?

632
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,070
All emotions, affections, and desires

633
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,630
mean nothing to you.

634
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,880
All you ever know is to protect yourself.

635
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,920
You don't understand

636
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,360
or care about other people's pain at all.

637
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,590
I understand.

638
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,880
I understand it all.

639
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,110
I just can't feel it.

640
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,400
Tantai Jin,

641
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,920
you really are pathetic.

642
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,000
You're alive,

643
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,670
but you can't feel
the slightest beauty of this mortal world.

644
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,920
You can't even feel the pain

645
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
of this mortal world.

646
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,190
The only point of your existence

647
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,880
is to bring torment to others.

648
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,440
No!

649
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,000
To be despised and hated by others.

650
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,230
Why…

651
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,960
are you even alive?

652
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,360
No! That's not true!

653
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,590
But at least,

654
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,510
your mother never hated you!

655
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,320
She loved you till the very end.

656
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,230
If you could see her

657
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,840
and hear her say

658
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,230
how much she loved you,

659
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,070
you could break free from this fate.

660
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,320
Do you want to see her?

661
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,070
The chance is right before your eyes.

662
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,480
What are you waiting for?

663
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,710
[You must experience
all pain in the world,]

664
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,150
[and draw endless hatred.]

665
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,550
[You're carrying the curse of your fate.]

666
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,360
[You're destined to have a bitter end.]

667
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,760
[When your pain reaches its peak,]

668
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,590
[when your life reaches the end,]

669
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,960
[I will come and accept your sacrifice.]

670
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,630
I'm done waiting.

671
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,510
I'm not waiting any longer.

672
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,710
Tantai Jin!

673
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You can't die!

674
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,400
[Why is my power weakening?]

675
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,280
Xiao Lin!

676
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,360
Hurry, Junior Martial Uncle.

677
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,190
Ah, whatever. This will do!

678
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,550
We did it!

679
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,320
Where did she go?

680
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,000
So you ruined my vines.

681
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,230
I should've swallowed you

682
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,960
and let your soul disperse!

683

[Tantai Jin.]

684
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,710
[Why not have a taste of this demon?]

685
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,840
What are you talking about?

686
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,110
[Your blood deters
all demons in this world.]

687
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,710
[Your body can bear their demonic powers.]

688

[As long as they can't kill you,]

689
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,920
[you can use their power.]

690
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,880
[Do you feel it?]

691
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,400
[This power is what your body craves.]

692
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,630
[Isn't it more fun
than emotions and desires?]

693
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,110
Don't try to fool me again!

694
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,150
[With the whip of power in your hands,]

695
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,670
[you'll be the highest ruler
of this world.]

696
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,760
[This is the taste of power!]

697
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,880
[I promise you this,]

698
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,960
[once you've tasted it,]

699
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,110
[you'll never want to lose it again.]

700
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,710
Tantai Jin!

701
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,150
Tantai Jin!

702
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,150
Your Highness,
Miss Bingchang is over here.

703
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,630
Bingchang!

704
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,630
Where's that demon?

705
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,440
Was she blasted to ashes

706
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,440
by the charm I used?

707
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,000
Let's save the people first.

708
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,320
Bingchang!

709
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,000
Bingchang!

710
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,590
No…

711
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,440
No…

Tantai Jin!

713
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,550
[Am I back again?]

714
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:10,880
Miss!

715
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,230
Miss, you're finally awake!

716
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,630
I was worried sick!

717
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,150
I thought you were going to die.

718
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,960
Where's Tantai Jin?

719
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,760
Is he dead?

720
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,710
Mr. Tantai was placed
in the east-wing chamber.

721
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,630
He hasn't woken up yet.

722
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,230
But he's probably not gonna die.

723
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,110
Chuntao,

724
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,320
how did we get back?

725
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,760
I can't remember.

726
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,880
It was Prince Lin who brought you back.

727
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:36,800
The imperial doctor said

728
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,480
you passed out just because

729
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,400
you were too weak.

730
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,630
Her Ladyship
and His Lordship sat by your bed

731
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,190
for a whole night and just left to rest.

732
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,030
What about my sister?

733
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,030
Is she alright?

734
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,510
Miss Bingchang is okay now.

735
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,880
Prince Lin is looking after her.

736
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,000
[The damages in the nightmares were real.]

737
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,840
[Thank god I stopped him
from slitting his throat.]

738

[Tantai Jin can't die.]

739

[But who can withstand]

740
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,630
[such a painful life?]

741
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,070
[If I can give him a hand,]

742
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,400
[would he be able to live normally]

743
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,510
[and not turn into Devil God?]

744

[you're actually sympathizing with him.]

746
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,150
[He destroyed Hengyang Sect.]

747
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,360
[He killed so many people.]

748
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,400
[He plagued the three realms
and four continents.]

749
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,110
[He must pay for all these debts.]

750
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,400
[Even if he's suffering so terribly now,]

751
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,670
[it's his fate.]

752
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,760
[But it's now five hundred years ago.]

753
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,440
[He hasn't yet killed anyone,
nor is he capable of causing harm.]

754
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,840
[Being constantly bullied]

755
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,960
[is simply cruelty for doing no wrong.]

756

[Since I was little,
Father taught me to be upright]

[and if I'm secretly happy for it,]

760
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,960
[I'll be confusing right from wrong.]

761

Miss Xiwu,

762
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,360
please have some rest before you see her.

763
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,840
Even if you want to see Prince Lin…

764
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,760
-Wait till you can stand properly…
-I'm going to see Tantai Jin.

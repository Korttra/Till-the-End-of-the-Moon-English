[The Way is Topgallant]

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,310
What? You want
to quit practicing the Heartless Way?

20
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,400
It's not like that, Father.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,070
It's just that I'm still attached to him.

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,430
I don't think I'll ever

23
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,280
make a breakthrough.

24
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,070
I'm not fated to attain godhood.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm sorry that I let you down, Father.

26
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,350
Get up.

27
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,430
Susu,

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,400
you sure Jiumin is the one?

29
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,710
Mm. Would that be fine with you,

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,240
Father?

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, sweet pea, my opinion doesn't matter.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,630
You know better than anyone

33
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,520
if he is a decent guy.

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,910
Besides, he was able
to refine the Heart-guarding Scale.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,800
And that's enough to prove that
he has the kindest heart and the purest soul.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,710
He's a reliable man you can count on.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,630

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,000

40
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,840

don't worry about

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,750
the evil bone.

50
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,590
I'll think of something.

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,190
Susu.

52
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,400
So you do have the evil bone.

53
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,310
Why didn't you tell me?

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,400
Do you have any idea how many

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,630
crave its power?

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,240
Was it Jiumin's idea to keep us in the dark?

57
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,240
He must be seeking a chance
to retrieve the bone.

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
That's why he's sticking around.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,840
No. That's not it.

60
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,910
He just found out a while ago.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,080
I didn't want to tell anyone because I thought

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,870
the evil bone would cause catastrophic havoc.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
How could you have been so careless?

64
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,030
You don't understand the scale of its power.

65
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,840
You may be of a pure spirit body

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,910
with the ability to keep out demonic energy,

67
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,030
but it's the evil bone we're talking about.

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,190
Even the Heavenly Pillar failed to contain it.

69
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,630
What makes you think you can?

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,520
I didn't have a choice.

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,190
I removed the evil bone using my divine essence,

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,000
only to realize it was indestructible.

73
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,830
So I had to seal it in me.

74
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,600
It was the Devil Sound Spell, again.

75
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,920
Baiyu,

76
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
I sent for you

77
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,800
because I've got a little job for you.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
What exactly do you want?

79
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,600
Everyone knows

80
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,240
he no longer has the bone.

81
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
If anything,

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,870
he has no value to you anymore.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That is none of your concern.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,950
Just bring me the devil fetus

85
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,560
and leave the rest to me.

86
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,360
But…

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Don't forget

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,040
why you're here,

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,390
Baiyu.

90
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,680
Unless you want all of them to die,

91
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,800
you will do as you're told.

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Understood.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,720
Si Ying and Jing Mie are coming for Jiumin.

94
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,510
They haven't found
out where the bone is, or have they?

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,120
I'd better get a move on.

96
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,120
Time is of the essence.

97
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,870
Susu,

98
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,160
after a lengthy discussion, your dad and I

99
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,040
decided to combine our powers to cast an array

100
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,800
for you at 12 midnight the day after tomorrow.

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
It's called the Yin-Yang Array.

102
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,800
To nullify the evil bone's power.

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,720
It's for our peace of mind.

104
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,750
Well, Father,

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,360
I know you two have been chewing it over

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,720
for the last 24 hours.

107
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,390
I can't describe how thankful I am.

108
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,360
Not to forget Uncle Zhaoyou.

109
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,920
He's been rushing around

110
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,070
making arrangements for my wedding.

111
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,160
This is a peaceful time for all three realms.

112
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,240
To our kind of people,

113
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,800
there's nothing bigger than

114
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,870
you marrying Jiumin.

115
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,240
Just know that we are really happy for you.

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
For now, put everything else behind you.

117
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
Speaking of which,

118
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,630
we owe a debt of gratitude
to your other father here.

119
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,950
We were mistaken about him.

120
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,390
Since the Demon Subduing Peak indicent,

121
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,160
he's been feeling guilty
for wrongly accusing Jiumin.

122
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,240
But being naturally unexpressive,

123
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,510
he left it unsaid.

124
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,870
When he heard the good news,

125
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,830
he offered to suppress the evil bone for you

126
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,390
at the risk of his powers being dried up.

127
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,630
He said that would be the only way

128
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,920
you and Jiumin

129
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
could live a carefree life.

130
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,360
"Call it a token of apology," as he said.

131
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
It's about time

132
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,750
you showed her the tiger.

133
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,270
This is…

134
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
a rooster-shaped stone?

135
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,040
Tiger.

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,240
He made it for you,

137
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,560
out of lava from the Barren Abyss.

138
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,120
He always wanted

139
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,680
to give it to you in person.

140
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,040
At the Barren Abyss,
I thought about what to give you every day.

141
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,800
In most cases,
giving kids tigers made of fabrics

142
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
is a more popular option.

143
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,830
There was nothing there

144
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,680
but stones.

145
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,190
The lava rocks were hard.

146
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,360
And I was weak.

147
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,120
I had to strike the rock

148
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,720
a little at a time.

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,390
Then one day,
it finally looked like the shape I desired.

150
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,040
And you,
my daughter whom I haven't seen in years,

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,240
are all grown up.

152
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,950
I did not do enough for you.

153
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,160
Now I just want to do whatever I can

154
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
to make amends.

155
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,510
Father,

156
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,830
I'll take good care of the tiger.

157
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,600
I have good news.

158
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,130
Both my fathers

159
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,890
have found a way to negate the evil bone.

160
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,890
They're going to cast a formation
for that in three days

161
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,610
How did you birth father know

162
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,970
the bone was in your body?

163
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,770
He heard me talking to my other father

164
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,250
about it.

165
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,370
He isn't an outsider anyway.

166
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,650
And this may surprise you,
but he's a very gentle man.

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,850
Relax, Jiumin.

168
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,680
As long as the evil bone's power is dampened,

169
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,090
you and I will live a long,
peaceful life together.

170
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,280
Don't you want to have
a full wedding ceremony this time?

171
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:13,970
Right.

172
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,970
Once you've completed your training,

173
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,280
I'll come and pick you up with bride token.

174
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,200
We'll get married again.

175
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,610
What makes you think I'll say yes?

176
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,560
Well,

177
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,400
Chief Qu did.

178
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,320
I have his permission
to be by your side forever.

179
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,970
Too late to back out now.

180
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,370
Aren't you worried

181
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,770
I'll shoot nails into your body again?

182
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,890
So…

183
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,440
that's a yes?

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,400
Oh, you.

185
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,130
You only hear what you want to hear.

186
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,650
Now,

187
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,970
according to Mount Changze's tradition,

188
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,560
we're not allowed to
see each other before the wedding.

189
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,250
Make sure you do a lot
of planning and preparation.

190
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,250
Because my fathers just might
call off the wedding

191
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,650
if you fail to meet their standards.

192
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,680
Okay.

193
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,490
I'll wait for you.

194
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,370
I'll bring enough betrothal gift

195
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,890
and pick you up at the pass.

196
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,730
It's your turn.

197
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,520
You old geezer,

198
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,560
what's wrong with you?

199
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,520
You don't play chess or drink.

200
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,560
Your mind

201
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,850
have wandered beyond the horizon.

202
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,400
This is something big.

203
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,970
Here.

204
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,370
Have a cup of tea first.

205
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,370
Wasn't I right about what happened

206
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,800
last time?

207
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,430
[Marriage Proposal]

208
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,200
Don't make me look bad.

209
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,520
After your beloved disciple

210
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,280
joins Hengyang sect,

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,370
will you regret it?

212
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,920
Qu, thank you for saving Jiumin.

213
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,890
Even though he is a devil,

214
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,250
he faintly showed the image of god

215
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,280
when he mastered the Heart-guarding Scale.

216
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,850
[This is sufficient proof that
he has a firm mind in cultivation.]

217
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,130
[Given time,]

218
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,890
[he'll be able
to take on the responsibility]

219
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,890
[of protecting the people.]

220
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,680
[You become serious]

221
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,850
[when we talk about him.]

222
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,200
[You're right.]

223
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,490
[Chief Qu, I'll trouble you then.]

224
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,890
[See you in three days.]

225
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,280
[Planning a wedding is a lot of work.]

226
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,090
[But does Lady of Spirituality remember]

227
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,730
[to go to the lake to meditate every day?]

228
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,610
[What about Jiumin?]

229
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,800
[besides coming to Hengyang Sect to peep]

230
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,250
[at Lady of Spirituality every day,]

231
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,610
[does he practice hard?]

232
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,320
Lady Susu.

233
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,400
You ask her.

234
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,160
Lady Susu, have you noticed that

235
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,130
there are always
some strange people around?

236
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,130
[Cang Jiumin, be patient.]

237
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,090
[We'll be together forever]

238
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
[after tomorrow.]

239
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,320
Our classes are cancelled tomorrow.

240
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,010
Chief wants to cultivate
in seclusion for a day.

241
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,090
What's happening?

242
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,130
Why does he want to do that?

243
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:01,770
Do you think

244
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,970
something big is going to happen
in the sect?

245
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,770
Something big?

246
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,090
The devil fetus's power is ruined.

247
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,400
What can happen?

248
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,650
I think

249
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,850
it is mostly related to something joyous.

250
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,560
Yeah.

251
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,200
But Cang Jiumin isn't worthy

252
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,010
of Lady of Spirituality.

253
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,440
He is a devil

254
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,010
who is millions years old.

255
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,800
I don't know what Chief is thinking.

256
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Keep your voice down.

257
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,490
Nian Baiyu is staying somewhere near here.

258
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,130
What do you call this?

259
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,090
Demon King, Devil God and evil cultivator.

260
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,920
Mount Changze has collected the whole set.

261
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,400
Knock it off.

262
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,160
Keeping quiet doesn't make you a mute.

263
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,040
Susu.

264
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,650
You'll lose all senses later.

265
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,250
But don't be afraid.

266
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,250
You just have to trust us.

267
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,040
Thank you, fathers.

268
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,890
Silly girl,

269
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,650
no need to thank me.

270
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,920
Uncle Zhaoyou will come

271
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,920
to propose a marriage
with betrothal gift for Jiumin tomorrow.

272
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,610
We'll have two happy events
to celebrate then.

273
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,560
Let's get started.

274
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,970
Sister,

275
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,490
what are you thinking?

276
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,520
You look happy.

277
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,850
Anything good happening?

278
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,010
We've found the entrance to Devil Palace.

279
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,680
We only need one thing from Hengyang Sect

280
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,320
and His Lordship will be resurrected soon.

281
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,650
It's a make-it or break-it attempt.

282
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Si Ying.

283
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,370
I've been thinking a lot lately
after coming round.

284
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,090
Whether a god, a demon or a human,

285
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,890
we all exist only for a short time.

286
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,250
So the most important thing
is to be good to yourself

287
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,490
and go after what you want.

288
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,090
You've dedicated your everything
to the Devil God.

289
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,770
Have you thought about

290
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,010
what you want?

291
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,560
Sister,

292
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,320
I want

293
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,130
whatever His Lordship wants.

294
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,850
Sister,

295
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,090
don't be silly.

296
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,280
You've given so much for the Devil God.

297
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,320
But what did he do for you?

298
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,280
His Lordship doesn't need
to do anything for me.

299
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,250
I did everything willingly.

300
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,010
Sister, I shall take my leave.

301
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,800
If all goes well,

302
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,560
the next time we meet

303
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,850
will be in the Devil God's presence.

304
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,680
Susu.

305
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,610
Susu?

306
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,610
It's the hour of the Rat
and the formation has ended.

307
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,680
Why hasn't Susu woken up?

308
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,250
She looks bad.

309
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,280
Could something go wrong?

310
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,920
What would go wrong?

311
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,010
Look.

312
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,090
Isn't the evil bone coming out?

313
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,370
What's going on?

314
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,680
No, why is this happening?

315
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,440
What's going on?

316
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,890
Isn't the formation supposed
to suppress the evil bone?

317
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,240
Sky-Slashing Sword.

318
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,440
If only you can judge

319
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,240
a man's character as accurately

320
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,160
as you judge a weapon.

321
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,240
That's right.

322
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,290
It's Sky-Slashing Sword,

323
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,890
the third demonic weapon.

324
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,290
Ten thousand years ago,
I stabbed the Devil God with it

325
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,330
and sealed him in the Barren Abyss.

326
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,720
Everyone thinks that

327
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,760
the Sword is missing
like other demonic weapons.

328
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,400
Actually, it's always been with me.

329
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,480
I've misjudged you.

330
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,760
Unexpectedly,

331
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,290
you've been after the evil bone

332
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,920
from the very beginning.

333
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,330
Chief Qu.

334
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,090
In fact, I admire an upright man

335
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,680
like you very much.

336
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,810
After I met Chu Huang,

337
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,680
I really wanted to be

338
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,370
a faithful good lover.

339
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Unfortunately, the Devil God's power

340
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,890
is too tempting.

341
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,760
In order to obtain that power,

342
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,240
I had no choice but to betray Chu Huang

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,370
and went over to the Devil God.

344
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,370
And I ended up meeting this child.

345
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,850
After I reunited

346
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
with Susu,

347
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,650
I was determined to make it up to her

348
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,240
and be a good father.

349
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,850
However, fate makes a fool out of people.

350
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,290
You can only blame

351
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,160
this child

352
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,570
for having a close connection
with the devil bone.

353
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,050
No! Don't hurt Susu!

354
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,570
No!

355
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,610
Susu.

356
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,720
No!

357
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,680
She is my daughter.

358
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,680
How could I have the heart to kill her?

359
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,330
After I take out the evil bone,

360
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,610
she only needs to get through the injury

361
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,130
to lead a peaceful life.

362
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,680
As her adoptive father,

363
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,370
you've worked hard for so many years
to bring her up.

364
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,440
Now,

365
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
you can rest in peace.

366
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
Susu.

367
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,850
you've made me wait
for thousands of years.

368
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,960
Finally, it's my time

369
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,810
to take control of the Devil God's power.

370
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,240
Your spiritual power is almost exhausted

371
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,130
and you're stabbed
by the Sky-Slashing Sword.

372
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,680
Why bother to struggle?

373
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,160
You greedy man.

374
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,050
You covet the power of the Devil God.

375
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,050
You have no right
to talk about karma with me.

376
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,960
Even if I use up my power
and my divine form is shattered,

377
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I won't let you take the evil bone away.

378
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,530
What a fool.

379
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,920
[As long as you are safe and happy,]

380
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,000
[no matter what you choose,]

381
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,440
I will be happy for you.

382
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,720
Even if you make the wrong choice,

383
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,240
don't be afraid,

384
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,890
I'll always be by your side

385
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,290
to catch you

386
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,370
when you look back

387
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,400
Father, thank you.

388
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,530
Susu.

389
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,090
I'm sorry

390
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,400
[I…]

391
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,130
[can't catch you.]

392
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,570
[Sister, something bad happened.]

393
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,680
Let's go.

394
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,610
[Something bad has happened.]

395
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,240
[I need to get His Majesty out of here.]

396
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,400
[Where am I?]

397
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,960
[Tantai Jin, so?]

398
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,920
[You said when the time comes,]

399
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,160
[you will return to the Barren Abyss.]

400
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,650
[I've found the entrance
to the Devil Palace]

401
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,400
[for you.]

402
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,680
[There's no better time than now.]

403
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,090
[Why am I here?]

404
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,240
[What exactly is going on?]

405
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,720
[Your Majesty,
I've bidden farewell to Chief.]

406
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,850
[Before leaving,
I want to catch up with you.]

407
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Bai Yu, why are you leaving suddenly?

408
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,850
I'm worried

409
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,200
about my family.

410
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,160
Your Majesty,

411
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
even if the two chiefs

412
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,050
defended you fiercely
at the Demon Subduing Peak,

413
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,610
your situation

414
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,290
hasn't been improved.

415
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,960
Have you thought about leaving here

416
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,610
and go back to the Yiyue tribe with me?

417
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,090
Baiyu,

418
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,200
I'm not a saint.

419
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Honestly speaking,

420
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,090
I don't like to be subjected to criticism

421
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,760
and have my life dictated by others.

422
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,610
But

423
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,130
as long as I can be with Susu,

424
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,290
I can bear with all these.

425
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,160
Your Majesty,

426
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,810
I heard that

427
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,160
you're going to marry
the Lady of Spirituality

428
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,610
and stay here forever.

429
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,890
But do you not care

430
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,850
[about Yiyue tribe anymore?]

431
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,290
My maternal tribe.

432
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,480
Speaking of which, I'm ill-fated.

433
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,050
Whoever related to me
will be struck by disasters.

434
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,200
Perhaps staying away from me

435
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
can stay away from trouble.

436
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,530
This is the best way

437
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,570
to protect my maternal tribe.

438
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,290
Your Majesty,

439
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,570
do you ever miss the days
when you could rally multitudes

440
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,130
with just one call as the ruler?

441
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,960
When you were the king,

442
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,050
With your governance,

443
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,090
things were in good order

444
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,480
and people lived in peace.

445
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,290
Don't you want to be back on that position

446
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,130
to protect your maternal tribe?

447
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,050
I don't know if I miss it.

448
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,610
It's been 500 years.

449
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,130
Many things are like dreamy illusions.

450
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,920
Perhaps

451
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,330
only this bright moon

452
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,160
is eternal and unchanging.

453
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,610
[Surprisingly,]

454
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,570
[your sidekick has some skills.]

455
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,200
[He really brought you back]

456
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,850
[without anyone knowing.]

457
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,050
[It's Nian Baiyu.]

458
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,890
[Why?]

459
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,680
[No, now isn't not the time
to think about these things.]

460
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,370
[Susu is waiting for me.]

461
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,480
[I need to find a way to run away.]

462
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,240
Cang Jiumin,

463
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,920
you're finally back here.

464
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
Do you feel

465
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,920
familiar?

466
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,610
I've never been here before.

467
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,850
Why would I feel familiar?

468
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,570
This is the gate to the Demon Realm.

469
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,850
The residence
of the Devil God's true form.

470
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,480
You were born with evil bone.

471
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,000
How could you not recognize this gate?

472
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,570
What are you hesitating about?

473
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,680
You are afraid.

474
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,330
You're afraid
that everything will be proven true.

475
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,680
[Since they're able to bring me here,]

476
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,890
[they must be well-prepared.]

477
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,370
[It won't work if I force my way out.]

478
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,090
[Or I'll comply with them first]

479
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,570
[and find a chance to escape.]

480
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,530
[Is this your home? It's so big.]

481
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,960
[Home?]

482
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,920
What is that?

483
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It's like an animal's den.

484
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,760
Mo Nv and I

485
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,050
used to call the cave
by the Chi River home.

486
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,240
But the Divine Realm took us back
for cultivation

487
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,610
We had no home since then.

488
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,760
This will be your home from now on.

489
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,480
Si Ying.

490
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,130
He really is the Devil God.

491
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,680
He's the Devil God we've been looking for.

492
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,330
What nonsense are you talking about?

493
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,920
If he is not the Devil God,

494
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,050
how could he lift

495
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,850
the interdict placed
on the Demon Realm gate?

496
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,570
Forget it. You won't understand.

497
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,480
In short,

498
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,960
there is no Cang Jiumin

499
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
or Tantai Jin.

500
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,090
He can only be the Devil God.

501
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,610
[Come.]

502
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,290
[Come to see me now.]

503
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,000
[You'll have the answers
to all the riddles.]

am the shadow of this world.

That's why I can't leave this world.

I've been existing alone in the demon realm
for god-knows how long.

Suddenly one day,

I've figured out something.

00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,880
There are sins in this world

557
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,720
because there's too much pain and happiness,

558

and chaos and order.

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,160
All these are born relatively to each other.

561

It's been like this since the beginning of time.

562

If this is the case,

563

pain won't be eliminated.

564
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,130
Why can't I go the other way around

565
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,130
and let this world have no clarity anymore?

566
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,160
All lives

567
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,360
will be indulged in pain due to the muddiness.

568
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,880
To create a peaceful world
without happiness or sadness,

569
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,650
I've created the All-in-Distress Way.

570
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,090

of clarity and muddiness,

there won't be any sins anymore.

from which I was born,

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,050
can they be free from the fate of annihilation.

674
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,410
That's why I was forced to work for them.

675
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,570
[I wish that one day,]

676
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
[I can help our people regain their freedom.]

677
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,050
Now there's only one way to save them.

678
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:42,970
And that is you

679
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,760
becoming the Devil God.

680
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,720
Please, Master.

681
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,200
Please save them.

682
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,410
In these people there's my mom

683
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,410
and the Moonshadow Guards

684
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,530
who once served you!

685
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,880
I'm begging you, Master!

686
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,530
Please save our people!

687
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,450
Just be the Devil God like they wanted, Master!

688
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,280
Please, Master!

689
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,760
I know

690
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,650
you want to save them as soon as possible.

691
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,760
But if I did what they asked,

692
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,490
the Devil God will be revived.

693
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,090
What about the lives in the
four continents and three realms?

694
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,610
People of Yiyue do matter,

695
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,650
but the lives of the
four continents and three realms

696
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,010
are just as important.

697
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,090
What a righteous speech.

698
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,240
Cang Jiumin, you're truly something else.

699
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,090
Who'd have thought

700
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,050
the one who least wants to revive the Devil God

701
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,200
is actually his devil fetus.

702
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,280
You've promised me

703
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,090
you won't hurt my master.

704
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,050
Why are you getting worked up?

705
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,570
Take a look at your master.

706
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,720
Does he look like he's worried for his life?

707
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,610
You'd better not lose yours

708
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,650
before you can save anyone else.

709
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,320
Get out.

710
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,680
I'm gonna

711
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,880
have a chat with our Devil God.

712
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,090
Si Ying,

713
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,450
aren't you afraid that I'll kill you first

714
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,320
after I become the Devil God?

715
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,450
As long as Your Highness can resurrect,

716
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,930
my life

717
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,090
is worth nothing.

718
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,360
Take your hand away.

719
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:10,970
Cang Jiumin,

720
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,280
this flesh of yours

721
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,360
is the Devil God's shell.

722
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,320
I wouldn't damage it for no reason.

723
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,240
After ten thousand years,

724
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,280
I've finally seen this face again.

725
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,880
I'm in a good mood today.

726
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,160
Let me tell you a story.

727
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,450
Have you seen this Yellow-red umbrella?

728
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,450
She's not an artifact spirit,

729
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,010
but my elder sister.

730
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:42,320
Elder sister?

731
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,570
She's called Mo Nv.

732
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,130
[And I'm called Si Ying.]

733
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,160
[We were born by the Chi River.]

734
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,930
[We depended on each other for living.]

735
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,970
[We lived our life without worries.]

736
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:54,880
Slow down.

737
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,240
[Until one day,]

738
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,610
[God of War Tian Hao
from the immortal realm took us away.]

739
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,930
[He put my sister into the Fire Cauldron.]

740
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,010
Later, it's His Highness

741
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,010
who killed Tian Hao

742
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,840
[and saved me.]

743
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,410
[My sister's primordial spirit was damaged.]

744
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,050
His Highness sent her spirit
to the mortal realm.

745
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,680
Her body

746
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,880
was fused with this red umbrella

747
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,880
and was always by my side.

748
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,680
[From then on,]

749
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,800
[His Highness had become my benefactor forever.]

750
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,680
[But ten thousand years has passed.]

751
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,610
Even my sister's primordial spirit has returned.

752
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,930
His Highness hasn't resurrected yet.

753
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,360
I feel guilty towards His Highness.

754
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,090
Guilty?

755
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,840
Is this the reason for you to do evil for him?

756
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,360
That's not the whole truth.

757
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,090
Although we do bring draught,

758
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,050
and eat travelers passing by,

759
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,970
that's just our nature.

760
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,360
Everything is for survival.

761
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,570
Just like beasts will hunt,
we are observing the laws of nature.

762
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:13,050
Why were the two of us alone
punished by the immortal realm?

763
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,280
Was what the gods

764
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,090
did to my sister and me

765
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,130
the truth?

766
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,450
I want the orders of the world to collapse.

767
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,160
Only His Highness's All-in-Distress Way
can rule the world.

768
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,450
How stupid.

769
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,720
Do you know

770
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,490
filial piety and fraternal duty

771
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,410
and proper human relationships

772
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,880
are the foundation of the order of the world.

773
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,200
Your deceptive narrative

774
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,240
is just for covering

775
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,320
your hatred to this world

776
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,450
and confusing its original order.

777
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,610
Your hatred towards this world

778
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,200
was originated from your love for your sister.

779
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,360
The world didn't fail you.

780
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,800
If you do this,

781
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,970
how are you different from Tian Hao

782
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,840
who hurt you and your sister?

783
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,200
You keep looking for a shell that's not him

784
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,570
because you can't let go of your obsession.

785
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,840
What you want

786
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,570
is but an illusion after all.

787
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,410
Your reasoning

788
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,160
is contradictory.

789
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,280
After living ten thousand years,

790
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,240
you're still so foolish.

791
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
How pathetic.

792
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,410
Shut up!

793
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,720
I'll pull your tongue out if not for

794
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,200
your use for His Highness.

795
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,200
Are you going to kill me?

796
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,880
How can I kill my master?

797
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,240
You're the devil fetus we've been waiting
for ten thousand years.

798
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,570
Why don't you let me serve you?

799
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,050
Just accept it.

800
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,880
I knew you wouldn't give up

801
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,530
returning to your sect so easily.

802
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,650
How about I show you something good?

803
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,800
While you were sleeping just now,

804
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,090
your subordinates didn't slack.

805
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,570

806

to the immortal sects.

808

What's wrong with him?

809
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,650
He doesn't look right.

810
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,320

What's going on?

813
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,610
Yeah, what happened to him?

814
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,130
Trying to play tricks?

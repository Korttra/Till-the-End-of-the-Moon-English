00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,670
Susu,

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,480
Jiwu,

172
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,000
let's go.

173
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,270
Let's go home.

174
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,360
[Susu,]

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,000
[why do you see me as a stranger now?]

176
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,870
Old Qu,

177
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,200
Susu is out of her meditation retreat.

178
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,870
You can finally be rest assured

179
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,440
after worrying for her for ten years.

180
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,390
Something doesn't seem right about her.

181
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,390
Her cultivation level actually dropped.

182
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,670
I wonder what exactly happened?

183
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
When you're free,

184
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,790
please check her fortune for me.

185
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,320
By the way, how're things going at Barren Abyss?

186
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,750
I'm here for this matter.

187
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,440
The Vigilant Bells have all been deployed.

188
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,510
Those demons

189
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,320
won't be able to cause trouble for now.

190
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
But then again,

191
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,600
this time I didn't see

192
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,150
the two arch demons Si Ying and Jing Mie.

193
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,270
I can't help but feel unsettled.

194
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,550
Their whereabouts

195
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,790
have been quite unpredictable lately.

196
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,030
I wonder if they have some other plans.

197
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,390
We must be careful.

198
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,320
Almost forgot.

199
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,630
The letter from my younger sect brother.

200
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Zhao'en?

201
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,000
Didn't he go to Yunchang Sect?

202
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,720
Luckily,

203
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,200
he survived

204
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,600
because he was half a day late.

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,080
I suspect that

206
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,360
this is exactly why the two didn't show up.

207
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,840
This is a serious matter.

208
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,240
It's best if we gather all sects to discuss.

209
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,000
But I heard,

210
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,720
Leader Cen of Chixiao Sect is still traveling.

211
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,600
When is he going to be back?

212
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,550
Leader Cen is most keen on killing demons.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,630
He'll return as soon as he gets the message.

214
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,720
Old Qu,

215
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,870
there's another thing I wanna ask you today.

216
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,270
Immortal Buxu told me to
go to the bank of Ruo Water,

217
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,910
saying that there's an auspicious sign
in the southeast direction.

218
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,670
He particularly said that I must go personally.

219
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,630
I went there like he asked,

220
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,480
and I saved a person from there!

221
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,240
Could you tell me

222
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,670
is this fortune or misfortune?

223
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
This isn't the Nether River.

224
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,320
Where is this place?

225
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,200
This is…

226
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,030
[That's right.]

227
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,630
[I sank into the depth of the Nether River.]

228
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,000
[Then,]

229
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,000
[it appeared.]

230
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,510
[I've seen]

231
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,910
[that black crossbow]

232
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
[in Bo're Life.]

233
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,240
Friend,

234
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,960
are you okay?

235
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,000
Come on, get up.

236
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,360
Are you alright?

237
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,440
When did you wake up?

238
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,480
Why didn't you tell us?

239
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
Why am I here?

240
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,390
My master found you and took you back.

241
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
My master is the leader of Xiaoyao Sect.

242
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,480
He's the famous

243
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,390
Immortal Zhaoyou in the immortal realm.

244
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,120
You are just so lucky.

245
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,030
I've cast a spell to rain divine raindrops.

246
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
With the protection of Heart-guarding Scale,

247
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,320
it won't take long

248
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,960
before this place becomes

249
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,480
a land abundant in immortal energy.

250
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
[This place is surrounded by mountains]

251
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,360
[and sunlight can't reach the valleys.]

252
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,360
[I shall name it Mount Buzhao.]

253
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,030
[This]

254
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,790
[is Mount Buzhao left by Ming Ye.]

255
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,120
Son,

256
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,120
you're awake.

257
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,720
Aren't you gonna say thanks to your savior?

258
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,750
[It's him.]

259
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,550
[Seems like Ye Xiwu could've been alive now.]

260
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,150
[But because of me…]

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,750
Thanks for saving me.

262
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,510
I still have something important to do.

263
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,750
I'll take my leave.

264
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,910
Don't leave just yet.

265
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,840
You're in such a hurry.

266
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,790
Are you returning to the Nether River?

267
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,600
Do you know the gate to the Ruo Water

268
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,440
only opens every five hundred years?

269
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,000
Even if you made it to the bank of Ruo Water,

270
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,150
how are you going to

271
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
open the gate of Ruo Water?

272
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,390
I can't stay.

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
I have to find her.

274
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,480
Are you trying to retrieve
her primordial spirit?

275
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,390
The dead can't back to life.

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,150
She's already dead.

277
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,870
What's the point of retrieving it anyway?

278
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,840
You're such a stubborn one.

279
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,480
Sect Uncle Buxu sent me a message

280
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,320
to tell me to save someone by the Ruo Water.

281
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,670
I thought I could find a treasure.

282
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,240
Instead I found someone as costly as you!

283
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,080
Do you know how many

284
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,440
valuable drugs and treasures from Xiaoyao Sect

285
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,910
I've used in order to save you?

286
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,670
I've tried so hard to get your life back,

287
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,600
but you just wanna walk away like this?

288
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,960
Then what do you want?

289
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,150
If I can't find her,

290
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,840
life and death have no difference to me.

291
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,670
Forget it.

292
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,840
I'll take it as a losing business.

293
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,910
I like doing things thoroughly.

294
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,320
If you really wanna kill yourself,

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,840
wait till you leave our sect property,

296
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,630
understand?

297
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,360
Master,

298
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,750
are you really letting him go like this?

299
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,510
Rest assured.

300
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,320
He can't leave this place.

301
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,960
He'll be back sooner or later.

302
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,670
Bravo!

303
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,910
[This should be an immortal sect
like Ye Xiwu said.]

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,550
[The gate to Ruo Water has closed.]

305
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,310
[I have to wait 500 years for it to open again.]

306
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,350
[It's easy to leave this place.]

307
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,310
[But where shall I go to find Ye Xiwu?]

308
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,830
Sect Brother.

309
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,590
You didn't try your best.

310
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll challenge you again.

311
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,030
I'll defeat you and your Zhuokun Sword someday.

312
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,680
Go.

313
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's go.

314
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,070
Let's go.

315
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,480
[Prince Tantai left his homeland]

316
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,310
[and became a guest in our Sheng Kingdom]

317
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,790
[for the peace of the two kingdoms.]

318
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,240
[We should treat him politely.]

319
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,510
[How can you bully him without scruple?]

320
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,830
[Back when we're in the Sheng palace,]

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
[I was a prince]

322
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,920
[and you were a hostage.]

323
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
[Our paths were nothing alike.]

324
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,310
[Another year later,
who'd have thought we will be at war]

325
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,350
[and become each other's archenemy.]

326
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,590
[I want you to pull your troops back]

327
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,880
[and stop the war.]

328
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,070
[Now what separates us will be]

329
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,440
[the boundary of life and death.]

330
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,830
[Brother Tantai]
[I know you don't wish to see me dead.]

331
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,790
[But death is my only way out.]

332
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,070
[Thank you for granting my wish.]

333
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Xiao Lin?

334
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,680
Xiao Lin.

335
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,400
You look new here.

336
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
Are you a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect?

337
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,750
How may I address you?

338
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
Why are you here?

339
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,640
Me?

340
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,680
I'm afraid you mistook me for someone else.

341
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,680
I am Gongye Jiwu.

342
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,240
Eldest disciple of Leader of Hengyang Sect.

343
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,680
Gongye Jiwu?

344
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,790
I see.

345
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,030
Since you're not familiar with this place,

346
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,590
let me walk you out a bit further.

347
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Honestly,

348
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,110
you look very much like one of my

349
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,440
old friends from many years ago.

350
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,030
I wonder where

351
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,110
you come from?

352
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,830
Maybe you two are related somehow.

353
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,880
I was…

354
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,720
Adopted by Immortal Buxu.

355
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,480
I know nothing of my origin, either.

356
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,030
[It's this Immortal Buxu again.]

357
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
May I see this Immortal Buxu?

358
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,240
He used to send me a message to save my life.

359
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,240
I'd like to thank him in person.

360
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,480
This is the place.

361
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,480
Since Immortal Buxu passed away,

362
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,240
he's been hiding in this golden flower.

363
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
Could you tell me

364
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,310
how he died?

365
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,000
It's said that he had traveled through

366
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,510
the mortal realm and seen every emotion.

367
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,750
He saw through everything

368
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,750
but couldn't acquire the method of immortality.

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
Till the year when he was ninety.

370
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,830
A new gambling house opened down the mountain.

371
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,640
He went there and won a fortune.

372
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,270
When he came back with his walking stick,

373
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,830
he got too excited and fell.

374
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,680
Then he died seven days later.

375
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
Then how should I thank him in person?

376
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,640
I just need to summon him with my spell.

377
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,590
Like this.

378
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,000
[Pang Yizhi?]

379
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,110
[I've come this time]

380
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,880
[to trade something with Your Majesty.]

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,350
[I want a bottle of your heart-tip blood.]

382
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,310
[Pang Yizhi,]

383
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,750
[why do you need this blood?]

384
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,400
[This doesn't concern you, Your Majesty.]

385
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,680
Is this his primordial spirit or an illusion?

386
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,000
Neither.

387
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,200
It's an interesting spell called Cloud.

388
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,270
It was created by Immortal Buxu.

389
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,510
He said that physical bodies will perish,

390
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,070
but consciousness lasts forever.

391
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,920
That's why he cast this spell before he died

392
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,640
to preserve his consciousness.

393
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,750
Brother Gongye,

394
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,310
I have some questions to ask Immortal Buxu.

395
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,680
Would you

396
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,640
leave us alone for a moment?

397
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,590
You may go ahead.

398
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,270
I happen to have other things to do.

399
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,960
I'll take my leave.

400
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Immortal Buxu.

401
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,920
Pang Yizhi.

402
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,920
Do you know where
Ye Xiwu's primordial spirit is?

403
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,440
How should I find her?

404
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,640
[If you want to tell your fortune,]

405
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,000
[you need to use a spell from my sect.]

406
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,680
Pang Yizhi!

407
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,920
Pang Yizhi!

408
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,790
[What are the secrets of this immortal sect?]

409
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,440
[The long dead Xiao Lin]

410
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,030
[actually stands here alive.]

411
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,830
[Why would Pang Yizhi tell Zhaoyou to save me?]

412
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,440
Son,

413
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,920
weren't you in a hurry to leave?

414
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
Why are you still here

415
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,310
till now?

416
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,480
Is it because Xiaoyao Sect is too big
and you've got lost?

417
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,350
Do you need me to walk you out personally?

418
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
I heard that your sect has the Cloud spell.

419
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,510
I'm here for a divination.

420
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
You need the help from Immortal Buxu's Cloud?

421
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
But,

422
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,590
if you want him to answer your question,

423
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,510
you must enter our sect first.

424
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,680
Only after you've learned our way

425
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,110
can you summon him with your divine energy.

426
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,440
[Since Xiao Lin is here,]

427
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,400
[could Ye Xiwu also be…]

428
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,750
[I need to stay to get to the bottom of it.]

429
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,680
Please enlighten me, Sect Leader.

430
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,070
Although you've kneeled to me,

431
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,640
I didn't agree to take you in.

432
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,510
It's not so easy

433
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,000
to join the Xiaoyao Sect.

434
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,640
How about this?

435
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,070
Get up.

436
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,510
How about you

437
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,960
go do something for me?

438
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,350
If you completed,

439
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,590
you won't owe me any drug or treasure.

440
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,440
What do you say?

441
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,480
As for accepting you as my disciple…

442
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,400
Come my sword!

443
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,720
This sword is called South Branch.

444
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,920
Forged by my master himself,

445
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,000
it was transformed from plum blossoms.

446
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,550
It has the heart of spring and soul of frost.

447
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,440
It carries no intention of killing.

448
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,160
If you see the world with this kindness,

449
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,440
you'll have no obsession

450
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,590
and see the true freedom.

451
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,830
I'll give it to you as a witness.

452
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,350
When you can awaken it,

453
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,640
you will have understood it.

454
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,750
Only then can you learn the immortal arts

455
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,480
to cultivate yourself.

456
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,110
[Susu,]

457
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,550
[you've been in a retreat for 10 years.]

458
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,030
[Your fatal punishment has passed.]

459
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,640
[Don't overthink anything.]

460
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,110
[Just take a good rest.]

461
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,830
[I've extract the evil bone from Tantai Jin.]

462
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
[The line of fate is broken.]

463
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,830
[There will no longer be a Devil God.]

464
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,400
[But what if this is merely a punishment?]

465
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,310
[Tantai Jin,]

466
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,920
[are you really just a dream of mine?]

467
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,110
[When the dream ends,]

468
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,550
[everything will disappear.]

469
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,240
Who's there?

470
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,510
Come out.

471
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,070
Junior Sect Aunt.

472
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,720
Who are you?

473
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,880
I…

474
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,750
I'm not a bad guy.

475
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,590
I'm also a disciple of Hengyang Sect.

476
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,750
So,

477
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,720
you're a disciple of Sect Sister Yao Wei?

478
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,480
You've never seen me before?

479
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,920
Since I was admitted into the sect,

480
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,270
I've heard that Hengyang Sect has a

481
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
pure-bodied Junior Sect Aunt.

482
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,830
But you're in a meditation retreat all along.

483
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,920
I could only see that thundercloud.

484
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,160
I was so curious.

485
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,400
But when I saw you just now,

486
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,480
I didn't know why,

487
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,480
but you looked so familiar to me.

488
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,790
Sect Niece,

489
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
what's your name, please?

490
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,400
My name is Yue Ya.

491
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,110
You can just call me Yue Ya,

492
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,750
or

493
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,030
Little Moon.

494
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,590
You're called Yue Ya?

495
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,400
Yeah, Junior Sect Aunt.

496
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,160
What's the matter?

497
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,790
[My name is Yue Fuya.]

498
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,480
Sister,

499
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,750
you saved me,

500
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,510
right?

501
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,240
Your original name is Yue Fuya.

502
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
You're from the Yiyue Tribe.

503
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,070
Yue Ya is your new name.

504
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,750
Am I right?

505
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,440
You're so awesome.

506
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,240
How can you tell everything?

507
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,000
Fuya,

508
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,200
why would you come to Hengyang Sect?

509
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,590
A sister once saved me

510
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,160
and left a letter to my adoptive parents.

511
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
She told them to come here if they needed help.

512
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,680
Later, when I was 15 or so, I was sick.

513
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,000
No doctor could treat me.

514
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
When I was about to die,

515
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,440
my parents sent me here like the letter said.

516
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,880
Fuya,

517
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:04,880
come here.

518
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,310
Fuya,

519
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,160
do you still remember the look

520
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
of your savior sister?

521
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,830
Savior sister?

522
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
From now on you're called Yue Ya.

523
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,960
Don't tell anyone your original name.

524
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,750
Understand?

525
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,960
[Wish we could meet again someday.]

526
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,750
Are you

527
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,550
the helpful sister?

528
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,590
Sister.

529
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,550
[All of this is not a dream.]

530
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,920
[Some people can still reunite.]

531
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,480
Sister.

532
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,480
[Someone makes me unforgettable,]

533
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,270
[but I'll never see him again.]

534
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,200
[Here it is.]

535
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,400
[In a village ten miles east
of Mount Buzhao,]

536
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,480
[there's a blind old woman.]

537
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,920
Zhi'er.

538
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,270
[She has been waiting for someone
at the village gate]

539
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
[for the past fifteen years]

540
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,750
[from day to night, rain or shine.]

541
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,550
Mom.

542
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,880
Zhi'er is back home.

543
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,310
Zhi'er.

544
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,510
Did I hear that right?

545
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,440
Zhi'er.

546
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,750
Is that you?

547
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,030
Zhi'er.

548
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,880
You've come back!

549
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,640
[The old woman
just has seven days to live.]

550
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,270
My Zhi'er.

551
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,510
[She's a kind-hearted woman.]

552
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,920
[Immortal Sect wants to satisfy her wish.]

553
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,350
[Unfortunately, her son is dead.]

554
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,070
Yes, Mom.

555
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm back.

556
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,440
Zhi'er.

557
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,720
Take a good rest.

558
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,640
I'll cook for you.

559
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,000
Be careful, Mom.

560
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,880
[Pang Yizhi may know something.]

561
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,830
[I have to stay at Xiaoyao Sect.]

562
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,070
[No matter where you are,]

563
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,400
[no matter how much time it takes,]

564
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,640
[I will find you.]

565
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,240
[Ye Xiwu.]

566
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,880
Yizhi.

567
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,160
Go.

568
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,680
Do you want to eat?

569
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,590
Yizhi, you know,

570
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,160
in the past 500 years,

571
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,480
Capital of Jing has changed a lot.

572
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,680
Why don't we often
go down the mount to take a walk?

573
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,680
Look, there's a storyteller.

574
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,030
A thousand years ago,

575
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,880
The Jing and the Sheng was one country.

576
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,880
Then it was separated into two by the river.

577
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,480
An emperor showed up

578
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,110
and reunited the two countries,

579
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,070
so that the flourishing age started.

580
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,920
As to what happened thereafter,

581
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,480
please come here next time.

582
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,000
Let's go.

583
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,920
All right.

584
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,160
Excuse me, sir.

585
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,000
[The Past And Present]

586
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,240
If you're not in a hurry,

587
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,400
please stay longer

588
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,880
to tell me another story.

589
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,720
What story do you want?

590
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,590
Tell me about

591
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,030
Tantai Jin of Jing Kingdom

592
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,480
500 years ago.

593
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,960
Okay.

594
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,070
Please sit down.

595
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Yizhi.

596
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,880
Who's Tantai Jin?

597
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,680
He's

598
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,590
the emperor of Jing Kingdom.

599
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,550
Five centuries ago,

600
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,270
the Jing was a weak country,

601
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,790
and many people lived in poverty.

602
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,160
Since Tantai Jin succeeded to the throne,

603
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,510
he turned the tide,

604
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,880
made great achievements,

605
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
and has created peace for centuries.

606
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,590
But tonight,

607
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,240
I won't tell you his well-known stories,

608
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,680
but an unknown story.

609
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,720
It is said

610
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,310
Emperor Tantai Jin had his beloved girl.

611
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,110
There is no word about the woman
in the history book.

612
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,030
Even her name is unknown.

613
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,070
She was not given a title,

614
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,350
but received special favor from the emperor.

615
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,680
It's said

616
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,720
after Emperor Tantai Jin passed away,

617
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
he was buried with his beloved woman

618
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,790
at Tantai Mausoleums.

619
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,110
In the next 500 years,

620
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,200
The royal Tantai family
has a lot of descendants

621
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
and wise emperors.

622
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,790
[He had let go of the past]

623
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,440
[and moved forward.]

624
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,240
[It's true.]

625
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,110
[When we were together,]

626
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,200
[we enjoyed happiness,]

627
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,550
[but also bore hatred.]

628
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,400
[I was just an ephemeral mote]

629
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,480
[in his life road]

630
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,110
[of being an emperor.]

631
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,440
[It's not worth remembering.]

632
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,350
[I should get over it]

633
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,400
[and go on my own road.]

634
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,590
Mom.

635
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:32,960
Mom.

636
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,270
Why are you standing here

637
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,110
early in the morning?

638
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
What time it is?

639
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,960
It's five o'clock.

640
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,720
Not right…

641
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,960
It's Spring Equinox today.

642
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,400
There's a plum tree in the courtyard
that is very important to me.

643
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,000
You go see if it has bloomed.

644
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,880
[It…]

645
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,070
[It has already withered away.]

646
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,400
The tree has been there for ten years.

647
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,960
Every year I hope it will bloom.

648
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,070
But I never make my wish come true.

649
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,030
[The most painful thing about living]

650
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,310
[is that we can't get rid of memories,]

651
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,920
[Likewise, I'm trapped in the nether land,]

652
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,830
[being washed by Ruo Water]

653

[with my broken heart.]

00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,680
[To satisfy the granny's wish,]

655
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,070
[I have to help her let go of the past.]

656
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,830
Pretty.

657
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,000
Mom.

658
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,190
Today

659
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,630
is the last day of nanny
living in the world.

660
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,670
By any means,

661
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,320
I have to satisfy her wish.

662
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,670
[Zhi'er.]

663
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,360
Good son.

664
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,840
Come here.

665
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,230
I have something to talk with you.

666
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,230
What's the matter?

667
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,590
Zhi'er.

668
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,110
What do you think human live for?

669

I don't know.

670

People live for the sake of others.

671

Others?

672
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,030
If not for waiting for my son,

673
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,000
I would have been dead.

674

675
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,670
who would remember or miss

676
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,400
my son?

677
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,230
Mom.

678
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,190
I…

679
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,710
But I'm here.

680
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,920
I'm blind in the eyes,

681
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,760
but in my heart,

682
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,280
I know

683
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,800
you're not Zhi'er.

684
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,110
It's kind of you

685
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,840
to accompany me at the end of my life.

686
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,590
I don't have any regrets anymore.

687
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,590
What about you? Kid.

688
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,400
Where is your home?

689
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,710
Is anyone thinking about you?

690
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,550
No.

691
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,110
I lost my mom since I was young.

692
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,070
My father hated me.

693
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,280
Although some people

694
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,230
around me,

695
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,760
I've never been missed.

696
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,590
But

697
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,710
I had a wife.

698
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
She protected me

699
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,710
and saved me.

700
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,710
She tried to

701
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,030
help me to be a good person.

702
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,030
Have you become a good person?

703
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,760
I…I don't know.

704
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,030
She taught me to be kind,

705
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,030
to be merciful,

706
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,880
and to love others.

707
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,230
However, I caused her death.

708
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,230
Now no one can tell me

709
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,840
what kind of person I'm anymore.

710
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,550
If you can find your wife back

711
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,230
when you turn into a bad person,

712
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,960
would you do that?

713
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,110
[She's right.]

714
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,030
[If I have the power of Devil God,]

715
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,440
[I'll find a way to find Ye Xiwu.]

716
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,550
No.

717
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,150
She would not be happy

718
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,190
to see me do that.

719
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,510
That's right.

720
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,670
If you miss your wife indeed,

721
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,480
you shall satisfy her wish.

722
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Do you understand?

723
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,190
What do you mean?

724
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,550
Kid, look.

725
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,000
Look at the plum tree.

726
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,030
Has it blossomed?

727
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,630
Zhi'er had planted the tree before he left.

728
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,800
He said

729
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,630
he would be back

730
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,630
when the plum tree bloomed.

731
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,320
I often water the tree,

732
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,760
because I hope

733
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,800
it's still alive

734
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,760
when Zhi'er comes back.

735
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,800
So he won't feel so sorry

736
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:55,110
for my old age.

737
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,840
That's the way it is.

738
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,190
I think…

739
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,550
I think I've figured it out.

740
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,880
[Nanny's son is the past
that she has been trapped in.]

741
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,400
[And this plum tree is the key
to unlocking this.]

742
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,550
[As long as nanny thinks
the plum tree is blooming]

743
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,670
[so that her son won't feel sorry
when he's back,]

744
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,670
[nanny will be satisfied.]

745
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,550
[The sword is named Nanzhi.]

746
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,320
[With spring heart and frosty soul,]

747
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,590
[it drives away chillness.]

748
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,880
[Taking Nanzhi Sword as the branch]

749
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,800
[and nurturing it with spiritual power,]

750
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,230
[one can drop his obsession]

751
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
[and be free.]

752
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,880
[Plants wither, flourish, and return.]

753
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,000
[All lives live in contentment.]

754
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,320
[Shatter.]

755
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:55,630
Mom.

756
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,230
Look.

757
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,840
It has blossomed.

758
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,710
I picked up one for you.

759
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,840
Thank you.

760
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,440
You're a nice person.

761
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,630
Mom.

762
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,000
[Nanny.]

763
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,320
[You have live a complete life.]

764
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,190
[You'll be blissful in your next lifetime.]

765
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,030
Immortal Zhaoyou.

766
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,000
Could you be my master?

767
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,710
I want to be your disciple

768
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,150
and stay here for cultivation.

769
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,920
Good.

770
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,110
Kid.

771
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,070
I think you have a bond
with immortal sects.

772
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,840
I knew you will come back.

773
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,400
You got out of Nether Water

774
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,800
and survived.

775
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,920
Before you join in our sect,

776
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,710
I'm going to give you a new name.

777
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,760
I used to be surnamed Cang.

778
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,280
I'll give the surname to you.

779
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,710
You're surnamed Cang.

780
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,840
Your first name is Jiumin.

781
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,710
How's it?

782
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,800
What does Jiumin mean?

783
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,550
It's not the time

784
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,280
to tell the secret.

785
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,400
Do you like

786
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,800
the name of Jiumin?

787
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,710
Thank you, Immortal Zhaoyou.

788
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,920
Immortal Zhaoyou?

789
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,360
Thank you, Master.

790
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,480
Good.

791
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,320
My disciple.

792
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,320
The nanny's wish

793
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,280
has been fulfilled.

794
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,550
I give the sword

795
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,920
back to you.

796
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,360
I'm a beginner

797
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,760
and don't need good weapons.

798
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,670
Jiumin.

799
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,190
What are you worried about?

800
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
You

801
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,840
awakened the sword.

802
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,710
In that case,

803
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,110
it has belonged to you.

804
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,920
Keep it.

805
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,440
Come.

806
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,710
I'll show you around Xiaoyao Sect.

807
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,480
Jiumin.

808
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,710
There are six peaks in Buzhao Mount.

809
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,480
The middle peak is named

810
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,360
Xianglu Peak

811
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,710
which is the tallest one.

812
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,880
When the devil weapon was born,

813
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,920
mountains and the earth break.

814
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,360
Buzhao Mount emerged at that time.

815
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,840
Mountains merged into one.

816
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,110
The six peaks stand out.

817
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,710
The sky is like a dome.

818
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,400
All of this form a natural formation.

819
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,000
Our Xiaoyao Sect

820
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,800
is in the middle.

821
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,280
We take the sky and ground as the furnace

822
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,480
to refine all things.

823
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,000
How time flies.

824
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,800
The place that had been soaked
in devil energy

825
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:22,920
now

826
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,150
has become an immortal sect.

827
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,840
Feel free,

828
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,510
do what you want to,

829
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,550
and go where you want to go,

830
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,590
which is called Xiaoyao.

831
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,960
Therefore,

832
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,760
Xiaoyao Sect created a unique technique

833
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,030
which is called

834
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,670
Xiaoyao Sword-play.

835
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,110
Sword following your heart

836
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,880
and making numerous changes.

837
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,190
Since you've unsealed Nanzhi Sword,

838
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,320
now I'll

839
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,440
teach you to use Xiaoyao Sword.

840
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,960
But you must remember

841
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,320
sword-play follows your heart.

842
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,320
Before practicing the sword-play,

843
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,670
you need to practice it.

844
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,110
[Bone-refining Seal
is the heart of Devil God.]

845
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,400
[Ye Xiwu.]

846
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,760
[Is it pretty?]

00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,360
[Only when I forget about Tantai Jin,]

848
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,800
[I can gain stronger power.]

849
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,030
[Li Susu.]

850
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,480
[Focus.]

851
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,400
[I can't go on like this.]

852
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,150
[The person I like is you,]

853
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,230
[not anyone else.]

854
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,760
[Ye Xiwu.]

855
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,360
[Are you giving up on me?]

856
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,710
[When I tried to forget about Tantai Jin,]

857
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,440
[for a moment,]

858
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,070
[my power became stronger.]

859
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,760
[I should let go of the past]

860
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,510
[and go on my own road.]

861
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,510
[Is this Heartless Way?]

862
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,880
[If I don't move with it]

863
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,070
[ang practice Heartless Way,]

864
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,360
[I'm afraid when my attainment
is exhausted,]

865
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,550
[the power of Heaven Lake
won't seal the evil bone.]

866
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,110
[Tantai Jin had lived his lifetime]

867
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,360
[as a wise king.]

868
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,880
[I shouldn't]

869
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,880
[let myself be trapped in the memory]

870
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,360
[and be tortured.]

871
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,670
[So this is the life in immortal sect.]

872
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,000
[This is the place]

873
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,630
[where Ye Xiwu used to live.]

874
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,150
[Ye Xiwu.]

875
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,510
[If only I can]

876
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,630
[feel the life 500 years ago.]

877
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,190
Brother.

878
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:23,920
Brother.

879
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,440
You left in a hurry that day.

880
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,400
We haven't introduced to each other.

881
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,550
I'm Zang Hai.

882
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,800
If you need any help,

883
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,840
you can come to me.

884
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,760
Thank you.

885
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,510
He's Zang Feng.

886
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:38,510
Brother.

887
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,480
You're new here.

888
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,070
Let me give you some advice.

889
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,440
Among the disciples of our master,

890
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,110
Zang Hai ranks second.

891
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,110
I rank the third.

892
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,030
What about you?

893
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,880
Every new disciple

894
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,320
would have a new name.

895
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,230
What's your first name?

896
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,150
Cang Jiumin.

897
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,960
You don't have the same surname as us.

898
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,880
Cang is the master's previous surname.

899
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,880
Are you his relative?

900
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,320
I didn't know the master before.

901
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,670
The master must
have given him the name for a reason.

902
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,880
Stop speculating.

903
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,710
Jiumin.

904
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,760
Let me tell you about our senior brother.

905
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,920
Let me tell you.

906
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:14,800
His name is Zang Lin.

907
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,070
He's a crazy martial artist.

908
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,360
He has a problem in here.

909
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,800
A problem?

910
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,710
Zang Lin.

911
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,760
Zang Lin is just

912
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,400
obsessed with practicing martial arts

913
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,110
and is more hardworking than others.

914
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,190
Yeah…

915
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,960
You're the new disciple?

916
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,510
Why don't we compete?

917
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,630
You must have something special.

918
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,480
Show it to me.

919
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,360
-All right.
-Jiumin.

920
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,800
You're injured. Take a rest.

921
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,590
We're leaving.

922
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:52,510
Go, Zang Lin.

923
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,710
Have a competition next time.

924
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,630
Have a competition with me.

925
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:56,920
Junior brother,

926
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,670
the immortal contest counts for much.

927
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,510
Don't forget to practice your sword skills.

928
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,320
The divine is doing me a favor
in cultivation.

929
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,190
Ye Xiwu.

930
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,840
Uncle Zhaoyou,

931
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:25,880
what's wrong with you?

932
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,070
You know,

933
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,630
I'm gonna need a drink

934
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,630
at the sight of someone with a cold face,

935
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,000
playing a profound thinker.

936
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,000
Or I will be uncomfortable head-to-toe
and with eye twitching.

937
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,070
Where is your wine gourd?

938
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,590
I'll get you a pot of it.

939
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,480
No.

940
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,190
Trifles like getting wine in the future

941
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,670
will be left to my new dear disciple.

942
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,840
But you're such good as I see,

943
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,280
how about I get you something?

944
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,070
Soothsaying your marriage.

945
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,960
Please!

946
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:00,320
Susu has made up her mind
to practice the Heartless Way.

947
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,440
Susu,

948
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,400
the Heartless Way's no joke.

949
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,110
Have you carefully weighed

950
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,320
pros and cons of it?

951
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,070
Susu has been in suffering for a decade.

952
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,630
But it's more like experiencing nirvana.

953
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,550
In her body,

954
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,510
everything has been reshaped.

955
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,150
A lot of weird stuff goes on
in Hengyang Sect.

956
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,550
Susu is still young
and hasn't been in love.

957
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,190
How has she ever been in love suffering?

958
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,800
And why does she change
to practice the Heartless Way?

959
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,110
It seems

960
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,710
Tantai Jin is my love suffering.

961
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,550
Dad and Uncle Zhaoyou
need not worry about me.

962
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,590
Now that I've shown my resolution to Dad,

963
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,760
there is no need to hesitate here.

964
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,400
Susu,

965
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,590
You may go back.

966
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,590
It's surprising to me.

967
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,110
What Susu said just now

968
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,190
isn't like words a common ignorant girl
would speak.

969
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:12,670
Susu.

970
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,000
Gongye.

971
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,800
Susu,

972
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,190
I have something to tell you.

973
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,280
Instead,

974
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,480
she is like having been
through storms and stress.

975
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,590
Okay.

976
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,360
Susu,

977
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,320
we've known each other since childhood.

978
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,630
Over the past decade,

979
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,960
my love for you has been rock-solid
every day.

980
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,710
Senior brother,

981
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,320
unexpectedly there is one day

982
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,110
that I'm afraid to look at your face.

983
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,800
Senior brother,

984
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,590
I'm about to say thank you.

985
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,280
I was so young and immature before

986
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,590
and fatheaded in doing things.

987
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,000
But you didn't mind about this.

988
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,360
You often help me

989
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,440
and instruct me.

990
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,360
I'm grateful for it.

991
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,030
I haven't found a way to repay you.

992
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,030
Susu,

993
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,670
have you got nothing else to say

994
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,880
in addition to gratitude?

995
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,760
What about our engagement…

996
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,280
You are close

997
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,510
to me

998
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,320
and I respect you.

999
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,030
That's it.

1000
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,030
As for my marriage,

1001
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,920
I'll find a way to tell my dad

1002
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:40,510
that I shall decide by myself.

1003
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,960
You're really a different person
than you used to be.

1004
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,800
I get it.

1005
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:50,920
Susu,

1006
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,800
I'll prove it to you.

1007
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,590
My love for you hasn't changed

1008
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,000
whether it's in the past or now

1009
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,920
and what you've been through.

1010
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
I wonder

1011
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,670
if you'll think of me as your marriage partner

1012
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,960
in the future.

1013
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:06,030
There's still time.

1014
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,630
Senior brother,

1015
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,550
I'm unsure what will happen

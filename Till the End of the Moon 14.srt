00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,020
[Episode 14]

18
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,230
It hurts.

19
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,280
It's not right.

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,350
If my injury is healed,

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,920
will the demonic energy come back?

22
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,120
Forget it, I can't hold back Ming Ye.

23
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,150
But will Ming Ye care about

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,190
my sincerity?

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,190
The two gods wanted to

26
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,800
test the king's sincerity.

27
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,240
One transformed into a small white dove

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,360
and the other transformed into a hawk.

29
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,430
The hawk chased the white dove

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,520
and the dove
pounced into the arms of the king.

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,120
The white dove pleaded with the king,

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,120
"Please save me, save me quickly."

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,240
The king, being a sincere person,

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
said to the hawk,

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,190
"You can eat my flesh."

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,800
The hawk said, "I can eat your flesh,

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
but I want to eat the amount of flesh

38
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,910
that is the same weight as the dove.

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,680
Otherwise, won't I be at a loss?"

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,750
The king agreed,

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,590
so he had someone bring a scale.

42
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,240
He put the dove on one end of the scale

43
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,560
and cut a piece of flesh

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,630
from his leg
and placed it on the other end.

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,190
Guess what happened?

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
The weight of the flesh was not enough.

47
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,400
So the king cut
another piece of flesh from his leg

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,430
and placed it on the scale,

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,960
but it still wasn't enough.

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,870
He cut all the flesh from both legs,

51
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,590
but it was still not enough.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Why?

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,430
I have seen doves before.

54
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,000
Doves are much smaller

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,470
than the fishes in our river.

56
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,630
That's because these two gods

57
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,190
wanted to test the king's sincerity.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,470
However, what they didn't expect was that

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,240
the king stood up with difficulty

60
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,870
and threw his entire body onto the scale

61
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,150
to exchange the dove's life.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,280
As a result, it was the king's sincerity

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
that moved the gods.

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,360
The king's body was completely restored,

65
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,120
and he ascended to become a god.

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,590
However, I still don't understand

67
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,280
why someone's sincerity needs to be tested

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,120
by cutting their flesh and blood.

69
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,120
So many people pray to the gods,

70
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,310
claiming that they are sincere.

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,630
If he is not faced with
unbearable suffering,

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,920
how can we know if he is truly sincere?

73
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,120
I can't give in.

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
I can't have Ming Ye worry about me.

75
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,070
I haven't seen Sang Jiu these days.

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,120
Where is she?

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,070
Could it be true, as Tian Huan said?

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,310
No. I have to go and ask her.

79
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,600
Ming Ye,

80
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,510
I'm going back to
the Mohe River for a few days.

81
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,630
No need to worry about me.

82
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,600
Is she avoiding me?

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
Wars have been frequent recently.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,920
I wonder if Sang Jiu
has returned from The Mohe River.

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,000
Why can't I meet her?

86
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
I miss Ming Ye so much,

87
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,360
but I can't go to him.

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,240
Ming Ye,

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
I heard that you went to battle again.

90
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,750
I pray for your safety.

91
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,160
I have had feelings for you
for a very long time.

92
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,720
Ming Ye,

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,560
when can you see my sincerity?

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,190
Before, my nanny always said
when she couldn't sleep at night,

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,190
she had to gather
demonic energy to make pearls

96
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,360
so as to pass the time.

97
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,510
She actually accumulated
a full bag of pearls.

98
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,600
I once made fun of her,

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,480
but I didn't expect that
I am doing the same so soon.

100
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,750
When my shift is over,

101
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,630
I must go back and find Sang Jiu.

102
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,560
Even if she is really avoiding me,

103
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,190
I must see her.

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,390
Report!

105
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,430
The traces of a demon group
have been found 300 miles away,

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,430
but they don't have any intention to attack.

107
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,120
They are gathering towards the Demon Realm.

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Towards the Demon Realm?

109
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,720
Yes.

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,120
Follow me.

111
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,720
Let's go spy on them.

112
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes.

113
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,270
All gods arrive.

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,310
Ming Ye,

115
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,240
Did you find any information

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,830
during your search in the Demon Realm?

117
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,920
The Devil God did take action

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,240
and has sinister intentions.

119
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,390
Therefore, I have summoned everyone

120
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,800
to discuss a solution.

121
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,360
This time, I sneaked into Barren Abyss

122
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,870
and discovered that the Devil God
is practicing a formation

123
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,120
called All-in-Distress Way.

124
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,720
It seems that this formation can devour
all positive energy in the world,

125
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,310
causing all living beings to die
and demons to thrive.

126
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,680
If he succeeds,

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
wouldn't this world become the purgatory?

128
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,160
We mustn't allow him
to open the All-in-Distress Way!

129
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
But now, it seems that

130
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,870
the Devil God is like an arrow on the bow,
ready to be released.

131
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,440
How can we stop him?

132
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,200
Is there no way to kill the Devil God?

133
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,080
Ming Ye,

134
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,600
since you called us here,

135
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,720
do you have any good ideas?

136
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,440
Yes.

137
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,670
When the Devil God practices the formation,

138
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,480
he will extract the evil bone

139
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
and personally guide the negative energy
of heaven and earth.

140
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,960
As long as the evil bone
is not destroyed, the Devil God won't die.

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,270
So,

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
when the evil bone leaves his body,

143
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,080
the Devil God can be killed.

144
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,960
This will be the only chance.

145
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,080
But the evil bone connects
the Devil God and the All-in-Distress Way.

146
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,720
How can we get it?

147
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,960
That's right, Ming Ye.

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,840
How should we assist you?

149
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
And what do you plan to do?

150
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
We can set up an ambush
near the Devil Palace.

151
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,320
When the formation is activated,

152
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,720
the Devil God has to
defend the formation's center.

153
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,000
At that time, I will do my best
to force him away from the center

154
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,670
and stop the formation.

155
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,030
Then I will go with you.

156
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,080
There are many
demon soldiers in the palace,

157
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,200
but I can use the power of
the God of Cosmos to freeze time

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,870
and separate the demon soldiers
with the Time Freeze.

159
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,120
This way, you only need to deal with
the Devil God alone.

160
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm the God of Universe.

161
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,720
I can be anywhere in the universe,

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,320
so I can take advantage
of the Devil God's unpreparedness

163
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,910
to take the evil bone
away from the Devil Palace

164
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,910
and seal it in the Heavenly Pillar.

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,670
The Heavenly Pillar is
the supreme place in the universe,

166
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,870
where the spiritual veins of heaven and earth converge.

167
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,720
It is indeed capable
of sealing the evil bone.

168
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,240
The God of the Sun,

169
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,270
Please grant the Nine Palaces
and Eight Trigrams Heavenly Formation.

170
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,150
It seems that it's time
to use this formation.

171
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,270
Indeed.

172
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,840
To trap the Devil God,
we can only use this formation.

173
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,630
The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams
Heavenly Formation is granted by the Heavens.

174
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,510
This formation was created
to imprison demons,

175
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,670
but once activated,

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,870
both gods and demons will be trapped

177
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,030
and unable to escape, except for Chu Huang

178
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,270
who can control space.

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,870
Ming Ye,

180
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,790
are you sure about this?

181
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,960
The Devil God is born from
the negative energy of heaven and earth.

182
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,240
What nurtures him

183
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,440
is the endless pain,

184
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,360
sadness and hatred in this world.

185
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,790
As long as there is
pain and sorrow in this world,

186
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,550
the Devil God will be immortal.

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
Even as gods,

188
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,600
we cannot match him.

189
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,150
Now we can only gamble on this last chance.

190
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,670
When Ji Ze and Chu Huang leave,

191
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,910
I will use my true form
to hold the Devil God,

192
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,840
trapping myself with him in the formation.

193
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,440
I won't give up until death.

194
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,000
You don't have to worry about me,

195
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,240
even if I'm trapped in the formation,
it's nothing.

196
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,390
I can just risk my divine body
to fight until death.

197
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,600
It's not a big deal to me.

198
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,080
Since you are so brave
and risking your lives,

199
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,550
why should we save our divine power?

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,750
If necessary,

201
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,750
we can burn up all of our divine power.

202
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,240
When the Nine Stars are in alignment,
I will move the stars

203
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,390
and rain down celestial punishment

204
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,870
to assist you in killing the Devil God.

205
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,270
Under the punishment,

206
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,750
everything will be destroyed

207
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,030
and the Devil God
will not be able to escape.

208
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
Even if we exhaust all gods' divine power,

209
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
we can only activate
the Celestial Punishment once,

210
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
so we must aim carefully.

211
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,480
I might not come back

212
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
from this journey.

213
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,630
I bid my farewell.

214
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,510
From now on,
the survival of all living beings

215
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,960
in the Three Realms will depend on you.

216
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,240
Little Ming Ye, you can go.

217
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,320
Don't worry,

218
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,030
we will take this responsibility.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
I, Ji Ze, is honored

220
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
to know you all.

221
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,440
I have lived a fulfilling life in the
Shangqing realm for thousands of years.

222
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,790
Now I have no regrets.

223
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,200
After seeing you off this time,

224
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,670
I don't know how many of you will return.

225
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,750
Maybe after this battle,

226
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,240
there will be no more gods in the world.

227
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,390
It will be a new start.

228
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,750
Everyone,

229
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,750
hopefully, we will meet again.

230
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,750
I heard that someone is assisting her
in co-cultivation outside.

231
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
So,

232
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,240
she probably doesn't need you anymore.

233
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,960
I might not come back

234
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,790
from this journey.

235
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,790
I bid my farewell.

236
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,600
From now on,
the survival of all living beings

237
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,790
in the Three Realms will depend on you.

238
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,080
So be it.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,750
I will die and my soul
will be destroyed on this journey.

240
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
If Sang Jiu has found the person she loves

241
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,150
and to stay with,

242
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,320
it's better than being alone
in Yuqing Palace for the rest of her life.

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
Sang Jiu,

244
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,150
I'll let you go.

245
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,200
After I kill the Devil God,

246
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,720
and then you can live happily ever after

247
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,790
with the one you love.

248
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,670
Did Ming Ye ask you to give it to me?

249
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,790
Yes, Lady.

250
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,390
Lady!

251
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,600
Lady!

252
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,200
Ruby.

253
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,440
Goddess.

254
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,080
Send it to Lady Sang now.

255
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,960
Yes.

256
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,720
Ming Ye.

257
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,600
Ming Ye!

258
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,630
Ming Ye.

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,670
Ming Ye!

260
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,200
Ming Ye!

261
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,440
What's the point of
sending a piece of paper?

262
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,510
 If you really don't want to see me again,

263
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,600
just tell me face-to-face.

264
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,600
Ming Ye.

265
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,200
Ming Ye!

266
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,200
Ming Ye, say something!

267
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,200
Ming Ye!

268
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,270
Sang Jiu,

269
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,320
You have 24 hours

270
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,750
to pack up and leave Yuqing Palace.

271
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,150
Leave Shangqing realm.

272
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,750
What are you talking about? Are you crazy?

273
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,630
What did I do to piss you off?

274
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,440
For so many days,

275
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,720
I dare not say

276
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,310
or do anything.

277
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,510
I am even afraid to look at you

278
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,110
and talk to you for a few moments.

279
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,200
And now you don't even want to look at me,

280
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,160
are you planning to
use a piece of paper to drive me away?

281
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,480
From the beginning,
it was your father who forced me.

282
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,510
I didn't have any affection for you.

283
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,440
The safety and stability of
Four Continents and Three Realms rely on me,

284
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,200
but you wouldn't stop pestering me.

285
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,200
You asked me to teach you swordsmanship

286
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,880
and clear your negative energy,

287
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
but I'm already tired of these things.

288
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,510
Now I can only abandon you.

289
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,350
Because I bothered you?

290
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes.

291
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,200
Unbelievable.

292
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
I tried to avoid you

293
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,640
and not to bother you,

294
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,720
but

295
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,510
things still ended up like this.

296
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,240
My dad once told me a story

297
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,960
about a king saving a white dove.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,350
He told me that

299
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,240
the king cut off his flesh to feed the hawk

300
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,510
in order to save the dove.

301
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,750
But it was still not enough.

302
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,030
The gods are so unreasonable.

303
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,720
Why someone's sincerity needs to be tested

304
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,510
by cutting their flesh and blood.

305
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,400
That's because these two gods

306
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,830
wanted to test the king's sincerity.

307
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,270
However, what they didn't expect was that

308
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
the king stood up with difficulty

309
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,510
and threw his entire body onto the scale

310
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,510
to exchange the dove's life.

311
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,550
As long as you have sincerity,

312
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,400
the gods

313
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,270
will definitely be moved.

314
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,790
I thought I had enough sincerity,

315
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,240
but the god never turned his head for me.

316
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,110
Ming Ye,

317
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
I will go back to pack my luggage.

318
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
And I will leave

319
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,790
before the sun is out.

320
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,750
Sang…

321
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,510
Ming Ye.

322
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,510
Ming Ye,

323
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,510
I want to ask you one thing.

324
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,750
Have you ever,

325
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,790
even a little bit,

326
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,880
for even one second,

327
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,000
had any feelings for me?

328
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,960
Sang Jiu,

329
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,310
From the moment you and I arrived

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
in the Shangqing realm
on our wedding carriage,

331
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,920
Why don't you have one too?

332
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,830
Why are you eating everything you see?

333
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,160
to the moment you ate
the untouched divine fruit,

334
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
and to your each and every move
when we were together…

335
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,880
never,

336
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,200
I've never loved you.

337
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,400
Sang Jiu,

338
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,350
you must forget me.

339
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,830
I wish you happiness.

340
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,510
Sang Jiu. It's you.

341
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,590
I'm leaving.

342
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,680
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

343
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,550
Alright.

344
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,440
I didn't know you could drink.

345
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,160
Okay,

346
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
it's just what I want.

347
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,590
Sang Jiu,

348
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,240
you got something you want to say to me?

349
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,240
No.

350
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,590
Before I go,

351
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,590
I just want to get

352
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,160
what's owed to me.

353
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
What?

354
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,830
You owe me

355
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,510
wedding night sex.

356
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,510
Relax.

357
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,310
I created this toxic orb myself.

358
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
It weakens a target physically.

359
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,920
It's nonlethal.

360
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,590
Jiu…

361
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,350
Jiu…

362
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,590
Oh,

363
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,920
it also takes away the target's voice.

364
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,070
After tonight,

365
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,920
we'll call it even.

366
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,160
And I hope our paths never cross again.

367
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,270
Jiu,

368
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,240
I know it wasn't the best way to say goodbye.

369
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,720
I'm sorry that I let you down.

370
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Today,

371
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,960
this very day…

372
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,160
After everything that has cost us,

373
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,680
all that preparation,

374
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,270
it's all…

375
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,720
for this fight.

376
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,790
The Devil's Army has gathered near Devil Palace.

377
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
The Devil God is planning to cast
All-in-Distress Way over all three realms.

378
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,510
If his plan works,

379
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,680
it means the destruction of all lives.

380
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,590
A complete annihilation.

381
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,680
I must condemn him. Who will join me?

382
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,750
We will gladly join the fight!

383
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,400
We will gladly join the fight!

384
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,110
We will gladly join the fight!

385
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,550
We will gladly join the fight!

386
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,200
We will gladly join the fight!

387
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:05,240
Lord of Evil! Lord of Evil! Lord of Evil!

388
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,160
Lord of Evil,
you have control over 100,000 evil cultivators.

389
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,880
That's a crazy number of followers.

390
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,240
No need for formality.

391
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,550
After all, we are all at the Devil God's disposal.

392
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,030
Please, call me Di Mian.

393
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,510
Oh, you truly care about

394
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,350
your own kind, don't you?

395
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,240
Now I see why you fell out with your wife

396
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,310
to cross over to the Devil God.

397
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,310
I can't imagine what it would be

398
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,400
if you ran into her in front of the formation.

399
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,830
Right now we've got bigger fish to fry.

400
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,480
We need to think of a way to

401
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,750
strip our opponents of their powers.

402
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,790
My Lord.

403
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,830
Today, all three realms shall be mine.

404
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,000
The formation of All-in-Distress Way will suck
all the positive energy out of the universe

405
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,590
and fill the space with negative one.

406
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,160
Before long,

407
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,000
all living things will turn evil.

408
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,960
We will come together to share pain.

409
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,750
Si Ying, Jing Mie, Di Mian,

410
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
offer your devil energy.

411
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,310
Use the devil artifact as a medium

412
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,590
to combine our powers to create the formation.

413
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,310
So that's the Devil God's
ultimate weapon of mass destruction, huh?

414
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,960
It is my great honor

415
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,270
to be part of this.

416
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,320
Let's all dive into sadness.

417
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,360
Huang,

418
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,150
I'll leave it to you.

419
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,590
Ye, how are you holding up?

420
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,510
Where are you now?

421
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,630
What have you been up to since we parted ways?

422
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,800
The war must still be occupying your time, I guess?

423
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,110
I still think about you sometimes. Can't help it.

424
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,480
I'm worried about you.

425
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,320
I just hope you'll live a long life.

426
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,670
Ming Ye.

427
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
You're still alive.

428
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,960
I can't die just yet.
The Devil God is still in one piece.

429
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,110
Let's get him!

430
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,710
We have to stop the Devil God

431
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,760
before the formation is successfully cast.

432
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,670
Time is of the essence.

433
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,590
I'll be off to the Demon Realm first.

434
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,030
The Devil God isn't our only problem there.

435
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,070
There are also three other Devils
and tens of millions of soldiers.

436
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
You're hopelessly outnumbered.

437
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,360
You can stop the Devil God all by yourself.

438
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,630
That's all the more reason for me to go first.

439
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,670
I can lure away those three sidekicks of his,

440
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,510
leaving him all alone.

441
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,030
This is outrageous.

442
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,920
Jing Mie, step aside.

443
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,590
Ye did manage to

444
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,000
keep them off the offering altar.

445
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,760
Let's just hope everything goes as planned.

446
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,320
Ye,

447
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,880
I'm ready.

448
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,110
Devil God,

449
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,280
your turn.

450
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,670
How dare you disrespect His Lordship?

451
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,360
Kill him.

452
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,960
This is a Time Freezing spell.

453
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,070
If you want to go back in time

454
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,400
and lose your powers,

455
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,190
by all means, go ahead.

456
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,190
Attention, soldiers.

457
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,280
Yes.

458
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,710
Today, we will make the evils pay.

459
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
We will purge the Demon Realm.

460
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,550
Or die trying!

461
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,590
Or die trying!

462
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,400
Devil God,

463
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,230
you actually created such evil magic.

464
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,480
If the formation is activated,

465
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,840
it will lead to
the annihilation of all three realms.

466
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,360
With everything gone,

467
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,550
so are all sins.

468
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,670
And I will return to nothingness.

469
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,880
Such a shame your followers

470
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
are under the wrong impression that

471
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,360
you'll be running the realms with them.

472
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,230
Turns out it's a suicide mission for them.

473
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,320
Jing Mie, ignore their soldiers

474
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,550
and break the Time Freeze spell.

475
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,510
The truth is, your hands are tied,

476
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,880
whatever my real intention is.

477
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,150
The God of Cosmos' Time Freezing spell

478
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,760
isn't strong enough to take on my evil soldiers.

479
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,320
Not to mention your divine power.

480
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,360
It can't harm me one bit.

481
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,480
Well,

482
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,590
not when our powers are combined.

483
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,230
A portal?

484
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,710
Well,

485
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,360
I hate to admit it,

486
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,110
but that blow was unexpected.

487
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,710
The God of the Universe.

488
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,670
You see, to me,

489
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,840
it doesn't make a difference

490
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,440
how many of them die for my cause.

491
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,590
The All-in-Distress Way formation has been broken.
And the negative energy has cleared.

492
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,800
Everyone, send in backup., now.

493
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,280
You broke the formation.

494
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,800
I see you people came prepared

495
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,510
You serpent,

496
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,070
what else do you want?

497
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,960
Oh, I didn't think the Devil God felt fear, too.

498
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,440
Aren't you full of surprise?

499
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,510
I'm not letting you get away with it this time.

500
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,710
I will kill you today.

501
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,920
I don't care how.

502
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,920
Oh yeah?

503
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,710
Well then, go ahead.

504
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,440
Show me what else you're capable of.

505
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,190
I knew it.

506
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,280
Removing the evil bone from his body

507
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,800
makes him vulnerable.

508
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,590
And once this bone is sealed,

509
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,320
we'll be able to take him out, once and for all.

510
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,510
Huang, it's almost time.

511
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,400
I got you.

512
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,280
No, I got you.

513
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
We're just getting to the best part.

514
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,280
It's time.

515
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,480
Nine Palaces
and Eight Trigrams Heavenly Formation,

516
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,440
initiate!

517
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,480
Initiate!

518
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,280
What's that?

519
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,630
It's Nine Palaces
and Eight Trigrams Heavenly formation.

520
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,590
As long as it stays intact,

521
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,630
no one,

522
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,960
not even the Lord,

523
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,960
can get out of here.

524
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,550
Huang, the evil bone's all yours!

525
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,280
Shit, my evil bone.

526
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,110
Catch up with His Lordship.
Kill all the soldiers of the God's Army.

527
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,480
The Devil God is trying to break through the barrier.

528
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,150
Hold on a little longer, guys.

529
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,280
No, he's trapped.

530
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,070
We did it.

531
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,840
Ye, are you okay?

532
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,550
I'm fine.

533
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,280
The barrier has been cast.

534
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,030
Nobody leaves the Demon Realm.

535
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,320
Together, you and I

536
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,190
can finish off the Devil God.

537
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,670
Stripping him of the evil bone
didn't seem to do enough damage to slow him down.

538
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,320
This is going to be one hell of a fight.

539
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:34,880
On the bright side,

540
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,670
with the barrier formed,

541
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,760
and that once the evil bone is sealed,

542
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,320
 it's only a matter of time
before we eliminate the Devil God.

543
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,800
Damn it.

544
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,280
I'm stuck in here.

545
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,590
What am I going to do?

546
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,800
That's the sign of Huang's divine power.

547
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,070
Where'd Di Mian go?

548
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,190
I thought we couldn't get out of this thing.

549
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,590
Follow His Lordship.

550
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,230
What's going on?

551
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,630
Ze,

552
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,400
your divine power is drying up freezing time.

553
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,400
You have to stop
or you're going to run out of divine essence.

554
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,150
The Devil God is gone.

555
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:11,670
What are you waiting for?

556
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,760
But you…

557
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,550
Please,

558
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:14,960
Ye,

559
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,150
we both have a duty to follow.

560
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,280
If one of us has to stay,

561
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,840
it'll be me, all right?

562
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,800
Trust me.

563
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:31,840
Ze!

564
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,110
Ze…

565
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,400
I want you to have this phoenix feather.

566
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,190
It holds all my divine powers.

567
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,320
No matter where you are,

568
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,630
if you want to see me,

569
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,710
it will bring you to me at once.

570
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,110
Give me the evil bone.

571
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,670
I will give it to you

572
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,630
over my dead body.

573
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,550
Huang,

574
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,510
hand over the evil bone.

575
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,230
With it,

576
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,070
I will become a Devil God.

577
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,070
And when I become the King of all three realms,

578
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,590
we can run the whole universe together.

579
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,630
Mian,

580
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,510
I thought you were deceived by the Devil God,

581
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,280
making you untrue to yourself.

582
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,400
But now you're telling me

583
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,550
you want the evil bone

584
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,960
for your own benefit?

585
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,670
Our benefit.

586
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,230
You are the Goddess of the Phoenix Clan.

587
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,880
I have to be the King of all three realms.

588
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,150
Only then will I be good enough for you.

589
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,360
Oh please.

590
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,400
Don't use me as an excuse

591
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,880
to cover up your despicable scheme.

592
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,320
It makes me sick.

593
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,320
Well, well, well.

594
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,880
Can't believe you just stole from my realm,

595
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,070
God of the Universe.

596
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,360
Ye.

597

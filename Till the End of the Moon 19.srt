165
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,630
Let's go and take a look.

166
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,240
Okay.

167
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,750
Xiwu,

168
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,240
there are conflicts everywhere.

169
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,360
Men like them have no choices.

170
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,000
Both you and Bingchang
got married to Tantai Jin

171
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,150
and Xiao Lin respectively.

172
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,720
You guys have no choice but to wander.

173
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,390
Your father could not cope with that fact.

174
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,360
Now that I have reached a certain age,
I have straightened out my thoughts.

175
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,600
I just hope that
the younger generations like you all

176
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,870
can stay safe.

177
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,870
I never expected us

178
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,030
to reunite in Jing Kingdom.

179
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
Bingchang is the only missing member now.

180
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,510
I hope Xiao Lin can protect her

181
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,440
and not let her suffer any grievances.

182
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,960
Miss Xiwu, you are overthinking it.

183
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,910
Even if Prince Xuancheng is gone,

184
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
there are plenty of men who will

185
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,240
protect Miss Bingchang.

186
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,150
Hey, why do you sound so jealous

187
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,390
when we talk about Bingchang?

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,630
Did she offend you?

189
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,550
Is it her fault for being likable?

190
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,080
Miss Bingchang wasn't
this popular back then.

191
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,390
However, the number of admirers

192
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,240
had increased considerably
in the past few years.

193
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,510
I just thought it was strange.

194
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,600
Is that so?

195
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,670
Xiwu.

196
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,630
Zeyu. Is Father asleep?

197
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,000
It has been a long time since our family
was this happy.

198
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
You had no idea.

199
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,670
Our trip here was hectic.

200
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,320
Aunt and the maids were scattered
as they escaped for their lives.

201
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,480
The soldiers of Sheng Kingdom

202
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,550
were on our tails.

203
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,840
It was excruciating.

204
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,600
However, we were lucky that
Tantai Jin dispatched a group of soldiers

205
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,390
to escort us.

206
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,080
That was how we were able to survive.

207
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,870
He gave us this mansion too.

208
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,960
So, Tantai Jin escorted you guys here?

209
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,750
That's right.

210
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,670
Our family would have been massacred

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
if we had to rely on that petty Xiao.

212
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,240
He also found physicians
to treat our grandmother and father,

213
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,750
but Dad drove them away.

214
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,480
But in the past,
you used to hit and scold Tantai Jin,

215
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,670
and I often bullied him too.

216
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,150
However, he didn't retaliate against our family.

217
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,150
Why is he being like this?

218
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,200
Yes. Why?

219
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,270
Girl, where are you going?

220
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,270
Taking a stroll in the Palace.

221
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,670
Moreover, on my journey

222
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,030
I have encountered many civilians,

223
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
and they don't care about
what the ruler's surname is.

224
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,510
They simply go wherever
there is a livelihood.

225
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,750
You have great governing skills,

226
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,840
not only do I like you
and want to follow you,

227
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,960
but everyone else likes you
and wants to follow you too.

228
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,670
I have also experienced the humiliation

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
of being dependent on others.

230
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,150
If I can prevent the people
from experiencing such suffering,

231
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,360
as a ruler, I would be
satisfied with my work.

232
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,390
Your Majesty,

233
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,790
Maid Ye is here.

234
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Let her in.

235
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:16,960
Yes.

236
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,480
Why aren't you bowing
when you come to see the king?

237
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,240
Tantai Jin, thanks.

238
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,390
For what?

239
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,200

for my brother and his subordinates.

243
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,630
Easy for you to say.

244

What?

245
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,870
Are you just going to
say thank you and move on?

246

Is that enough?

Would you like to
release it together tonight?

331

Wishing lantern?

332
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,640
Is it some kind of psychic sorcery?

333
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,400
Not a sorcery.

334

464
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
You get up close to them,

465
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,160
and their brain freezes.

466
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,750

474

475
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,640
I'm really bad at cooking.

476
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,240
Yes, that's it!

477
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,480
Let me tell you,

478
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,200
the way to a man's heart

479
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,110
is through his stomach.

480
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,720
You can just cook for him.

481
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,200
Even dogs won't eat what I cook.

482
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,070
It's not about the taste, but your heart.

483
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,440
You must feed him with your own hands,

484
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,350
every day, every meal.

485
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,200
That will double the results
with half the work.

486
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,400
And the worse it looks and taste,

487
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,400
the better.

488
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,440

489
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,590

490

00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,830
Wickedness befalls the wicked.

494
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,240
Wait till you get a taste
of Ye Xiwu's awful cooking.

495
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,750
Baiyu.

496
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,720
What does this character mean?

497
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,920
It's pronounced as "tao",

498
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,240
to describe the surging water in rivers.

499
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,030
Baiyu, why don't you go get some rest?

500
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,750
What "Huh?" Just go.

501
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,880
Okay.

502
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,830
What are you reading?

503
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,350
An ancient book of the Yiyue tribe.

504
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,550
No wonder.
I can't read a single character of it.

505
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
What are you doing?

506
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,750
This character looks so strange.

507
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,110
It's like a worm crawling out
from the earth.

508
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,160
What does it mean?

509
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,350
It means to sprout.

510
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,680
What about this one?

511
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,960
To smelt.

512
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,160
And this one?
Kill two birds with one stone?

513
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,720
It means…

514
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,000
It means…

515
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,960
You don't know either?

516
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,960
Should we get Nian Baiyu to come back?

517
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,640
I think he might know better.

518
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,440
It means "love".

519
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,200
Oh, that's it?

520
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,960
What's there to be shy about?

521
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,720
What are you doing here at night?

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,440
Can't I come just to see you?

523
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,160
Are you hungry?

524
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Get out.

525
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,960
Come on, at least take a bite.

526
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,400
I spent so much time
and even burnt my hand.

527
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,590
Ye Xiwu, serves you right.

528
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,400
Don't cook if you can't.

529
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,590
But I wanted you to like me.

530
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,720
Give it to me.

531
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
This is the first time

532
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,550
I actually cooked for someone.

533
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,510
I hope you won't mind
my lack of experience.

534
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,360
I'm sure I'll improve with practice.

535
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,880
Does it taste really bad?

536
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,480
Not really…

537
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,400
[Looks like I screwed up again.]

538
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,760
[I need to try something else.]

539
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,800
Just spit it out.

540
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,360
I won't cook anymore.

541
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,280
Why?

542
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,400
Why won't you cook anymore?

543
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,760
Persistence maketh a man.

544
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,360
Besides,

545
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,800
I don't think it tastes that bad.

546
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,760
[Fox was right.]

547
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,880
[The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.]

548
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,440
[It worked just like magic.]

549
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,440
[He can't even taste how awful it is.]

550
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,030
If you like,
I can cook for you again tomorrow.

551
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,480
Sure.

552
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,190
Here are two more dishes. Try them.

553
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,320
Maybe you'll like them better.

554
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,510
[The Soul-Slaying Teardrop is heating up.]

555
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,760
[Miss Fox wasn't lying after all.]

556
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,440
I'll leave you to it then.

557
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,480
[If there's a will, there's a way!]

558
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,400
[I'm gonna gather all the spikes I need.]

559
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,190
Your Highness, this is the demonic elixir
just crafted by our warlocks.

560
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,280
Your Highness!

561
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,960
Why is it so easy for Tantai Jin
to refine demonic elixir,

562
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,110
yet so difficult for me?

563
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,150
Perhaps we are simply built different to one another.

564
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,320
But Your Highness is as much a mortal

565
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,710
as Tantai Jin is,

566
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,440
you're no different in nature.

567
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,960
So…

568
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,550
If Tantai Jin can master the Firewing Army,

569
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,320
then so can I.

570
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Fu Yu.

571
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,110
Pay a visit to our allies for me.

572
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,320
Allies?

573
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm not the only one

574
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,670
who wants Tantai Jin dead.

575
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,630
Don't give yourself away
since Emperor Sheng is already suspicious.

576
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

577
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,190
General Ye,

578
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,590
I knew when I was a hostage in Sheng

579
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,960
that Xiao Yi is one to doubt others.

580
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,840
He even distrusts Xiao Lin,

581
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,000
his only son.

582
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,320
The Sheng has suffered heavy casualties
since the beginning of the war.

583
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,230
Xiao Yi must be feeling
extremely anxious by now.

584
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,030
If I push him further now,

585
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,230
he will be determined

586
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,510
to exhaust his troops

587
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,630
and become a burden to Xiao Lin.

588
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,070
Am I despicable for doing so?

589
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,760
All is fair in war.

590
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,440
The sooner we end the war,

591
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,670
the sooner our people can live in peace.

592
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,710
General Ye,

593
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,590
since you grew up in court,

594
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
who do you think is the far superior
between the Sheng's princes

595
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,070
and me?

596
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,440
Feel free to speak at ease.

597
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,440
In terms of strategy and wisdom,

598
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,230
Your Majesty is inferior to none.

599
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,800
But since Xiao Lin and his brothers
have been educated well

600
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,880
by knowledgeable scholars,

601
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,670
Your Majesty may be inferior to them

602
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,280
in terms of state affairs.

603
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,840
Nian Baiyu.

604
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,000
At your service.

605
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,030
Summon all great scholars in the nation

606
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,880
to give me lessons starting tomorrow.

607
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,590
Your Majesty,

608
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,960
these old scholars

609
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
have served the Jing nation all their lives.

610
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,400
They can be obstinate.

611
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,440
I'm afraid they won't come.

612
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,840
Those who disobey
shall be sentenced to death.

613
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,920
Your Majesty,

614
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,550
are you absolutely certain?

615
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
Only to scare them.

616
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,670
Will do.

617
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
If there are no objections,

618
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,440
let the lessons begin.

619
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,030
Your Late Majesty!

620
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,800
Your Late Majesty!

621
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,070
I've been faithful all my life,
yet I shall lose my loyalty today!

622
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,960
I would rather die than be dishonorable!

623
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,190
Are you okay, sir?

624
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,510
Your head certainly is hard.

625
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,280
You must have mastered the Iron Head.

626
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,070
Nian Baiyu.

627
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,590
Serve the gentlemen some refreshments.

628
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,880
We can start classes
once this gentleman has cried enough.

629
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:21,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

630
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,230
Tantai Jin!

631
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,550
You vicious monster!

632
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,590
You've oppressed the loyal commoners
murdered your brothers and taken innocent lives!

633
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,360
You are an outrage to the gods and people!

634
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,110
Heaven forbid!

635
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,440
Well said. Well said indeed.

636
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,000
If what you say is true

637
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,320
that I am so unfaithful, unfilial,

638
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,590
ungrateful and unrighteous,

639
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,320
then maybe you should educate me

640
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,880
and make it a great achievement

641
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,440
to pass on to your descendants.

642
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,150
Y-You… you make my blood boil!

643
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,590
What should we do?

644
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,880
I'm so infuriated I could die!

645
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,710
We've let His Late Majesty down.

646
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,480
Y-You're killing me!

647
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,840
From the emperor to the masses,

648
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,590
cultivating ourselves is inevitably the root of everything.

649
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,280
If the root is ungoverned,
all of which that follows shall be chaos.

650
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,760
Resentment by whom respect is shown
and respect by whom resentment is shown

651
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,150
can never cease to exist.

652
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:22,800
Our ancestors who illustrated virtue
throughout the kingdom,

653
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,320
had to first govern their own states.

654
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,360
In order to govern a state,
they first had to manage well their homes.

655
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,440
In order to manage their homes…

656
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,030
I'm sorry!

657
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,590
Why are you stopping? Go on.

658
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

659
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,320

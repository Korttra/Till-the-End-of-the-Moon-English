Come over.

173
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,030
You got a bee sting when stealing some honey?

174
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,790
Closer.

175
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,390
Still closer.

176
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,480
All right.

177
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,550
It no longer hurts.

178
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,320
Report, Goddess!

179
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,480
In a bamboo forest,

180
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,670
we found a trace of God Ming Ye!

181
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,670
Come on.

182
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,320
Sit here in the sun.

183
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,510
I'll be back before noon.

184
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,720
I'll bring back some bamboo shoots for soup.

185
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,830
All right.

186
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,440
Oh,

187
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,830
if you're thirsty,

188
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,160
the water is on the table in front of you.

189
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,550
Some leftovers in the kitchen.

190
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,550
If the wind rises,

191
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,880
you have to put on your cloak.

192
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,240
Yeah, right beside you.

193
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,030
All right.

194
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
I should go.

195
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,030
Ming Ye!

196
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,000
What are you doing in this place?

197
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
You're safe.

198
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,440
But why didn't you return or let me know?

199
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
I was badly wounded.

200
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
I stayed here and recuperated

201
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,000
just from some peace.

202
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Sorry to have kept you worried.

203
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,640
You've recovered, huh?

204
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,480
Ming Ye,

205
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,510
how much longer will you stay here?

206
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
You go back without me.

207
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,160
The scenery here is great.

208
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,030
I want to stay for a few days longer.

209
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,510
But you've just recovered.

210
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,030
You need someone to take care of you.

211
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,070
How about I stay?

212
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,720
Don't bother.

213
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,790
Someone takes care of me here.

214
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,790
If you don't mind,

215
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,440
I'm going back for some rest.

216
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,310
I have to tell you something

217
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,440
concerning a lot of people.

218
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,110
What is it?

219
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,350
Yesterday, celestial soldiers reported

220
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,920
they found the Devil God's Bone-refining Seal

221
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,480
in a valley.

222
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,680
That's why I hurried to you.

223
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,310
If the devil energy overflows,

224
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,510
I'm afraid...

225
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,790
The Bone-refining Seal has scary devil energy.

226
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,160
If the air or water is polluted,

227
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,550
the consequences can be catastrophic.

228
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,070
We must not delay a single moment.

229
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,350
Go.

230
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
You two lead the way.

231
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,550
-Aye.
-Aye.

232
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,640
Hold on a minute.

233
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,110
Here we go.

234
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,640
Ming Ye,

235
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,310
go with them.

236
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,880
I'll fetch a weapon from Yuqing Palace
and then catch up.

237
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,000
All right.

238
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,960
[Sang Jiu,]

239
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,590
[I'm in a hurry to leave.]

240
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,270
[Hearing that a devil artifact appeared,]

241
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,510
[I have to go take care of it immediately.]

242
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
[In one to ten days,]

243
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,880
[I will come back]

244
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,510
[and explain everything to you.]

245
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,790
[Sorry to leave without telling you.]

246
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,920
[I'll always miss you.]

247
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,350
[Ming Ye.]

248
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,640
The Bone-refining Seal is there in the center.

249
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,400
The hole was smashed.

250
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,510
After the Devil God was gone,

251
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,030
I had our soldiers search everywhere,

252
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,880
and finally they found this devil artifact.

253
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,510
Thank you for your hard work.

254
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,110
To have found the Bone-refining Seal

255
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,550
only consumed time and manpower.

256
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,880
Your complete disappearance for days

257
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
actually exhausted me.

258
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,310
Now, the Devil God is dead.

259
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,590
Without a master,

260
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,880
the Three Devil Artifacts are less powerful.

261
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
But their devil energy still floats for miles.

262
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
If we don't stop it,

263
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm afraid soon this place will be

264
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,030
a shelter for demons.

265
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,480
My father told me

266
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,750
among the Three Devil Artifacts,

267
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,160
the Bone-refining Seal has
the most inscrutable functions.

268
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,480
It can enhance the devil energy

269
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,510
and also make a seal or barrier.

270
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,480
When some celestial soldiers were captured,

271
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,000
they were deprived of their divine essence,

272
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
infused with devil energy,

273
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,400
and then became demons.

274
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,920
I really didn't dare to act rashly.

275
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,030
I had our men guard here

276
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,240
until I found you.

277
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,550
[Deprived of their divine essence?]

278
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,510
[Sang Jiu is my single daughter,]

279
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,400
[and the princess of our realm!]

280
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,830
For you, she extracted her divine essence

281
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,510
and could never be immortal!

282
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,070
[Now, you think you can move on]

283
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,720
[just by saying thank you?]

284
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,680
I'll be devoured by my demonic energy.

285
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,240
[If it can deprive someone
of his divine essence,]

286
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,880
[maybe it can also]

287
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,510
[help Sang Jiu rebuild her divine essence.]

288
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,960
I'll go check it out.

289
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,160
Ming Ye!

290
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,480
[This artifact appears to be evil]

291
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,720
[but is moderate inside.]

292
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,480
[Without any devil energy,]

293
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,160
[maybe it can be purified]

294
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,350
[and used in some other way.]

295
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,790
[The devil energy is stemmed
for the time being.]

296
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,160
[I have to get it out immediately.]

297
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,920
[The Seal has huge devil energy]

298
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,030
[and has gradually infiltrated into the earth.]

299
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,200
[Powerful as I am,]

300
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,440
[I can't easily get it out.]

301
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,440
[I think I have to do this.]

302
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,030
[Heart-guarding Scale.]

303
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,480
[This is]

304
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,160
[the hardest scale of mine.]

305
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,720
[With my divine power in it,]

306
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,640
[it can serve as a shield]

307
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
[to isolate the devil energy in the Seal.]

308
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,240
Ming Ye, how was it going?

309
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,030
The Seal crashed against the earth here.

310
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,480
They're nearly integrating.

311
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,350
For the Bone-refining Seal,

312
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,110
I have to exchange something.

313
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I then exchanged my Heart-guarding Scale for it.

314
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,510
The Heart-guarding Scale was in your flesh.

315
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
How could you just pull it out?

316
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,960
The bodily pain

317
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
wasn't much of a thing.

318
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,270
My father died
in the fight against the Devil God.

319
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,110
Now, you sacrificed your Heart-guarding Scale

320
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,270
for the devil artifact to protect people.

321
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,510
You deserve to be the God of War.

322
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,880
If Father knew about this,

323
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,200
he would be gratified, too.

324
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,590
I conjured a heavy rain.

325
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,750
And the protection of my Heart-guarding Scale,

326
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,750
it won't be long

327
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,310
before this place

328
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,750
has abundant spiritual energy.

329
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,200
Surrounded by mountains,

330
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,310
there's no light in the valley.

331
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,920
Let's call it Mount Buzhao.

332
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,720
It's quite considerate of you, Ming Ye.

333
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,750
Father had many subordinates and disciples.

334
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Only you followed in his steps

335
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,480
and knew his wishes best.

336
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,110
So, you would also protect

337
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,640
what my father had protected, right?

338
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,110
Let's go.

339
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,590
Back to Shangqing Realm first.

340
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,960

00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,400
If you want to hurt my people,

508
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
you'll have to go through me first.

509
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:23,510
Is this river a rogue-making machine or what?

510
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,630
You're seriously going to fight me?

511
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,440
What a vain, foolish man.

512
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,230
Come on, we've got to protect Father.

513
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,070
Absolutely.

514
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,510
Seize him.

515
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,190
You old clam demon

516
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,280
Thousands of years of cultivating,

517
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,440
yet you couldn't even take 100 blows

518
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,280
dealt from my Moon Blast.

519
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,280
And you call yourself a King?

520
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,630
That's funny.

521
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,280
Your son, on the other hand, was a handful.

522
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,400
But he, too, was defeated by me.

523
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,150
Tian Huan, what do you want?

524
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,440
To wipe evil creatures off the map.

525
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,280
I am told the Water Tribe of the Mohe River

526
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,590
is in cahoots with the Devil God
and is possessing a devil weapon.

527
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,510
These are crimes punishable
by familial extermination.

528
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,510
But... if you hand over the weapon,

529
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,150
only the one who leads gets punished.

530
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,960
The rest of you will be let off the hook.

531
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,280
In cahoots with the Devil God?

532
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,670
That's utter nonsense.

533
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,800
We, the people of the Water Tribe,
stay in our own lanes.

534
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,630
And we have done absolutely nothing wrong.

535
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,960
Is this the way
the people of the Shangqing Realm do things?

536
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,000
Framing people for crimes they didn't commit?

537
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,440
We offer protections to the three realms.

538
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,320
I don't need some puck

539
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,190
to tell me what to do.

540
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,400
So keep your opinions to yourself.

541
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,670
Why are you doing this to us?

542
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,710
Have you forgotten the kindness

543
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,280
we once showed you and Ye?

544
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,920
You're right.

545
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,440
There hasn't been bad blood between us.

546
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,800
So what makes you think it's a setup?

547
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,400
Because you're stone broke?

548
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,800
Because you're capable of evil?

549
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,510
Or because these crappy pearls of yours?

550
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:44,760
Goddess,

551
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,000
should we run this by the God of War?

552
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,510
Excuse me?

553
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,920
Well, he is...

554
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,400
he's the Clam King's son-in-law.

555
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,150
Mm, so?

556
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,360
This bunch of shellfish

557
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,400
forced Ye into

558
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,760
marrying that smelly clam.

559
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,190
He doesn't even like her.

560
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,280
He already dumped her.

561
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,590
Pretty bold of them

562
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,630
to set up that clam with Ye.

563
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,070
But... there's no sign of a devil weapon.

564
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,320
That's because you lot suck at your job.

565
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,400
Not finding any devil weapons
doesn't mean they aren't the Devil God's allies.

566
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,400
What?

567
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,840
Found your conscience

568
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,440
after killing so many

569
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,760
of the Water Tribe members?

570
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,440
Trust me.

571
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,840
They are in league with the Devil God.

572
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,550
We may not have found the weapon,

573
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,320
but they fought back,

574
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,630
which was suspicious.

575
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,440
These evil beings are cunning.

576
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,320
Our soldiers fought back
as an act of self-defense.

577
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,590
Don't worry.

578
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,360
Ye won't blame me for this.

579
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,320
We do not possess any devil weapons.

580
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,000
But one thing's for sure. You are bitter.

581
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,400
You're jealous because my daughter married Ye.

582
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,070
That's why you set her up.

583
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:50,960
I'm jealous of her?

584
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,110
A flying serpent is a spirit beast.

585
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,000
Why would I, the flying serpent Goddess,

586
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,030
be envious of

587
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,840
an annoying, unsophisticated

588
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,000
clam?

589
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,880
Let me tell you something.

590
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,030
When that b*tch of a clam
had an episode the other day,

591
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,070
I offered to look after her.

592
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,550
I added some freshwater to the spring water.

593
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,030
And I told her that was some Refining Spring.

594
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,440
That dumb woman actually took my word for it

595
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,510
and soaked in the water despite the pain.

will come back to you, you hear me?

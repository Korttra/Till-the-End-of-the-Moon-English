You're not as important as you think you are.

112
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,720
Like it or lump it,

113
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
when we collect all three devil artifacts

114

His Lordship will be brought back to life.

116
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,190
However,

117
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,360

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,190
I'll play nice with you.

119
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,390
You are, after all,
the devil fetus of His Lordship.

120
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,240

121

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,480
So are we supposed to just let him go?

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,550
He is essentially the devil fetus.

Don't know how I ended up here.

140

Now that you're back,

141
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,030
you should go and get some rest.

142

Father,

143
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,630
come inside and have a cup of tea.

144
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,910

[The Devil God hasn't returned.]

152

You're the devil fetus
the Devil God left behind, aren't you?

153
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,750
It's pretty bold of you to show your face here.

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,150
The disciples might take you down

155

159
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,630
You can stop pretending to be a man of virtue,

160
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,080
Lord of Evil.

161
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,630
If I hadn't known

162
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,120
you were once the leader of the Demon Clan,

163
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,480
a loyal follower of the Devil God
who massacred thousands of deities,

164
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,510
one of which was Chu Huang,

165
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,390
I thought you were someone else.

166
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,750
Who are you?

167
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,720
[If he's just a devil fetus,]

168
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,150
[how could he know
what happened thousands of years ago?]

169
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,750
[I can't put Susu in danger.]

170
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,120
[I'll find out who he is.]

171
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,790
[He's using Immortal Sect art.]

172
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,720
[But he is a devil fetus.]

173
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,000
[He should be able to do more than this.]

174
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,910
[I'll try again.]

175
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,600
Father!

176
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,080
Susu.

177
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,790
Don't come over.

178
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,000
You don't know this.

179
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,870
He is a…

180
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,550
I know.

181
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,790
I know what you're thinking.

182
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,390
But this man in front of us

183
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,440
is Chang Jiumin,

184
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,480
Xiaoyao Sect's disciple,

185
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,870
not someone else.

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,390
Sorry that I can't tell you

187
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,390
the reason why.

188
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,000
But please trust me.

189
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,030
Okay, Susu.

190
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,910
Don't worry.

191
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,870
I won't hurt him.

192
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
But you also have to trust me.

193
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,320
This man's background is far complicated

194
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,240
than you can imagine.

195
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,750
You should stay away from him.

196
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,510
Don't be fooled by him.

197
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
And I promise you.

198
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,870
As long as he doesn't hurt you,

199
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,960
I won't touch him.

200
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,480
I'll also keep this secret for you.

201
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,390
I see.

202
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,000
It turns out that

203
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,390
the Lord of Evil is your father.

204
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,390
Only Uncle Zhaoyou and he know about this.

205
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,480
Just pretend as if

206
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,270
you know nothing.

207
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,600
Don't blame him.

208
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,320
He is just a degraded devil

209
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,510
who has a blood feud with the Devil God

210
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,600
and thought that you were him.

211
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,440
After all, he's just a repented poor man

212
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,550
who is trying to make amends.

213
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,960
Ye Xiwu.

214
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,240
That isn't my name.

215
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,870
The person I know is Ye Xiwu.

216
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,240
That's not me.

217
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,080
The person you know

218
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,510
has never been me.

219
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,270
Tantai Jin.

220
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,510
Do you want me to keep lying to you?

221
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,870
But I've never lied to you.

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,440
I am Tantai Jin,

223
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,720
not what you dread that I'll become.

224
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,870
Ye Xiwu,

225
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,480
every day

226
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,790
in the past 500 years,

227
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,670
I've been carefully recalling

228
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,750
every moment I was with you.

229
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,670
And I've stayed in the Immortal Sect

230
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,080
for a while now.

231
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,630
I roughly know

232
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,510
what you're worried about.

233
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
I'm not Devil God.

234
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,120
Whether you'll tell me the truth or not,

235
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,670
I'll never turn into that.

236
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,750
I'll forever keep this

237
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,150
a secret for you.

238
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,240
It's better

239
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,000
to hide it from everyone.

240
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,390
I'll also not breath a word

241
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,960
about the Bone-refining Seal.

242
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
There's one more thing.

243
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,280
Bone-refining Seal isn't

244
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,960
the first devil weapon
I came into contact with.

245
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,320
There's also a Devil Crossbow.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,150
I told you

247
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,600
I'd been looking for you
in the Nether River for 500 years.

248
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,790
There, I discovered

249
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,630
and merged with

250
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
the God-slaughtering Crossbow by accident.

251
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,720
And that force

252
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,720
delivered me out of the Nether River.

253
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,480
That's how Master found me.

254
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,080
I don't know

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,960
how to take it out.

256
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,750
When I woke up,

257
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,720
I was already in Xiaoyao Sect.

258
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,150
If you don't believe me,

259
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,550
you can ask my master,

260
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,150
Master Zhaoyou.

261
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,320
No need.

262
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,750
Have you recovered?

263
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,910
I just suffered some minor injuries

264
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,120
when the Bone-refining Seal backfired.

265
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,080
I'm fine now.

266
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
I mean,

267
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,790
the burns you got

268
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,750
in the Nether River.

269
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,150
They were healed by Master.

270
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,200
Good.

271
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,390
You said Ye Xiwu

272
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,750
is just a dream.

273
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,280
But

274
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,550
in Shangqing Realm,

275
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,200
I saw the Hongnai Fruit tree
that was cut down

276
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,270
thousands of years ago sprout again.

277
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,480
Di Mian, the once Lord of Evil,

278
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,870
also has a chance to start afresh.

279
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,200
Do you think

280
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,320
there's a chance for Cang Jiumin

281
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,760
and Li Susu

282
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,960
to start over again?

283
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,000
Jiumin,

284
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,240
isn't it a good thing

285
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,440
that we're in the same sect now?

286
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,240

Isn't it the person

00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,960
who fought against us
on the Divine Platform a few days ago?

317

I know him.

318
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,270
He was my enemy
when I went through my tribulations.

319
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,240
Then he really is the devil fetus
Yiyue tribe lost

320
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,110
500 years ago.

321
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,720
He should have possessed
the supreme power of Devil God.

322
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
But he is deceiving himself

323
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
in the Immortal Sect.

324
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,310

Unexpectedly, he's your enemy.

326

330

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,750
I'll surely be able to revive His Lordship.

336
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,000
Everyone is worried

337
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,830
that the Devil God will resurrect.

338
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
If they find out

339
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,200
the devil fetus is living among them,

340
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,510
Immortal Sects will be thrown into a chaos,

341
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,310
pushing blame to each other.

342
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,350
And the devil fetus
will have no place to stay

343
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,720
but return to Barren Abyss.

344
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,510
Brilliant.

345
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,590
This is his past.

346
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,160
We should be able
to find his weakness there.

347
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,960
He is also there.

348
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,200
Who?

349
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,830
The man standing next to Cang Jiumin

350
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,400
is from Yiyue tribe.

351
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,200
He is working for Jing Mie now.

352
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,790
Are you saying
that Nian Baiyu is also in Barren Abyss?

353
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,790
That's right.

354
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,270
Let's do

355
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
something nice then.

356
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,830
I'll do as you say.

357
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,720
Chief Qu.

358
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,920
Master.

359
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,110
Your Majesty.

360
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,200
Nian Baiyu?

361
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,160
Jiumin,

362
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,030
you know this evil cultivator?

363
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,880
Yes.

364
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,270
He was my attendant in Jing Kingdom

365
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,880
500 years ago.

366
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,830
When we got separated,

367
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,310
I hadn't turned to the devil way.

368
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,960
I went astray laster on

369
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,960
and it had nothing to do with him.

370
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,200
In that case,

371
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,070
you're turning from evil to good

372
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,350
…and coming to Hengyang Sect

373
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,960
to look for you old master?

374
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,480
Yes.

375
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,830
Nian Baiyu is loyal and kind.

376
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,030
I believe that becoming a devil

377
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,310
isn't in his nature.

378
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,350
I hope you can give him

379
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,310
a chance to start over

380
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,200
on account of our years of friendship.

381
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,920
Your Majesty.

382
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,680
Since you've interceded for him,

383
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,110
well,

384
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,480
I'll let you stay.

385
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,440
Thank you, Chief Qu.

386
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,270
Thank you, Chief.

387
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,160
Get up.

388
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,240
Your Majesty.

389
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,200
Get up quickly.

390
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,240
Your Majesty.

391
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,000
I…

392
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,830
I'm no longer a king

393
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,000
and anyone's master.

394
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,510
Get up.

395
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,030
Baiyu,

396
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,920
no matter what happened in the past,

397
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,640
you can start

398
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
all over again now.

399
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,270
You don't have to stay by my side.

400
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,550
It's up to you whether you want

401
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,920
to stay in Hengyang Sect

402
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,350
or go back to Yiyue tribe.

403
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,160
I want to stay.

404
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,750
Good.

405
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,070
It's not easy for us
to reunite with each other

406
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,920
after a century.

407
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,720
You settle down first

408
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,510
Why are you here?

409
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,110
Yue Ya.

410
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,030
Chief told me to show a devil cultivator

411
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,240
to his room.

412
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,960
I didn't expect it to be you.

413
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,160
Why did a disciple
from Purple-of-Ursa Isles.

414
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,270
become a devil cultivator?

415
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,160
Miss Yueya,

416
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,400
sorry, I…

417
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,310
Chief asked me to settle you in.

418
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Don't worry.

419
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,110
I will do my best

420
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,550
to take good care of you.

421
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,240
Come with me, you liar.

422
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,200
This immortal is incredible.

423
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,790
Yes.

00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,400
Thanks you for helping us
fight off the monster.

429
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,000
Sister, look.

430
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,440
This is so pretty.

431
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,070
This is for you.

432
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,030
Let me have a look.

433
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,270
-Miss Mo Nv.
-Everyone, hurry up.

434
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,440
Opening a silk workshop
is indeed a great idea.

435
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,880
Not only can we accomplish the task
with Mr. Si Ying,

436
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,200
but we can also attract some lecherous
and brash men over

437
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,590
to suck the evil essence.

438
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,240
And no one will suspect us.

439
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,070
I've gone through cycles of reincarnation.

440
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,550
So I'm disillusioned with the world.

441
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
I've left Barren Abyss.

442
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,440
It is a charitable deed
if I could find you

443
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,310
a place to stay.

444
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,300

You can just call me Mo Nv.

I am the owner of this silk workshop.

They are all embroiderers.

474

Miss Mo,

475
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,110
There's a demonic energy around here.

476
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,680
I worry that there's a devil
wandering around.

477
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,550
I don't know if you've run into it.

478

Mister,

479
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,310
I heard there is a demon
in Capital of Jing.

480
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,160
Maybe it has run over here?

481
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,350
Don't panic.

482
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,350
The lantern in my hand didn't respond.

483
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,550
It shouldn't be somewhere near here.

484
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
This is a exorcising talisman

485
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,440
Demons are afraid of it.

486
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,960

505
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,720
I haven't seen Cang Jiumin all day.

506
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,440
I wonder what he is doing.

507
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,920
Cang Jiumin?

508
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,720
Lady Susu said
she wanted to take a trip to Jing.

509
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,240
I guess Cang Jiumin has gone with her.

510
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,110
What did they go to Jing?

511
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,200
Are you being a spy here?

512
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,400
You've asked so many questions.

513
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,440
Why are you so nervous?

514
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,270
I'm just joking. You're such a loggerhead.

515

What's the matter?

523
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,030
We've got news from Nian Baiyu.

524
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,790
The devil fetus has gone
to Capital of jing.

525
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,310
Surprisingly, he's a romantic type.

526
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,880
Since he cares so much about that girl,

527
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,750
why don't we make good use of that?

528

wait.

536
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,790
Who are you?

537
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Why are you doing here?

538
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm passing by this place

539
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,800
and want to spend a night here.

540
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,790
But the inn is closed.

541
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,110
I don't know what happened.

542
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
You better leave.

543
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,790
As night falls,
a demon will run rampant.

544
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,110
It's been more than half a month.

545
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,110
Everyone is terrified

546
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,270
and no one dares to go out.

547
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,480
You should stay

548
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,920
in another inn.

549
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,510
Why?

550
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Why can't I stay in your inn?

551
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,830
The demon target solo travelers.

552
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,830
My inn is the only one

553
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,110
on this street
that hasn't been attacked.

554
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,350
But it'll happen soon.

555
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,070
I'll be doomed if I don't close it.

556
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,110
This demon is so ferocious.

557
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,510
Why don't you get an exorcist
to deal with it?

558
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,310
This demon is so powerful.

559

The feudal government
has tried their best

Lady of Spirituality comes so slowly.

565
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,480
I've waited for you for a long time.

566
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,880
It's the opposite direction.

567
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,200
Why do you always follow me?

568
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,030
I finally got a chance
to walk down the mountain to have fun.

569
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,310
Can we just walk in a different direction?

570
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,480
Finally, you speak to me.

571
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,680
I was just wondering

572
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,270
when you suddenly become mute

573
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,510
as you were still normal
when you came down the mountain.

574
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,960
You follow me around.

575
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,510
You are just like a rascal.

576
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,440
You've wronged me.

577

I'm not following you.

578
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,750
Even after 500 years,

579

The Water-splashing Festival
of the Capital of Jing

580
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,200
was still run annually.

581

People from all over will join in.

582
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm a native of the Jing Kingdom.

it's you who is following me.

when you were in Xiaoyao Sect,
didn't you?

589
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,000
You didn't cultivate hard there.

590
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,440
Aren't you afraid
of encountering a devil when going out?

I hear that Emperor Jing offers a reward

The evil seems very vicious
in the Capital of Jing.

I'm worried about you.

You…

653
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,880
come here as well.

654
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,320
Lin,

655
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,280
so great that you are here.

656
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,030
You are adept at evil slaying.

657
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,480
Give us some advice.

658
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,670
Ok.

659
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,760
Why do you stare at me?

660
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,150
Because you're beautiful.

661
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,280
So based on the clues provided
by the locals

662
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,320
and what we know now,

663
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,400
the evil can change shapes and read minds.

664
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,480
Also,

665
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,030
when getting dark,

666
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,320
they can also deceive the divine artifact.

667
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,190
So the general warlocks
have to give up on her.

668
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,630
You have to know yourself
as well as the enemy to take that risk.

669
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,510
I read a book of List of Evils with Pictures
in the Scripture Hall.

00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,880
there is an evil called Ye Mei.

672
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,280
She can change her looks

673
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,960
and is a sucker for human brains.

674
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
She especially prefers those
who have felt the sting of love being rejected.

675
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,760
She will take advantage of you

676
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,110
if you have love thoughts.

677
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,400
The book Lin referred to was read by me.

678
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,480
A weapon is recommended in it

679
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,760
which can be used to track down Ye Mei.

680
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,760
But I can't recall the name

681
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,800
of the weapon now.

682
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:22,840
That's all right.

683
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,510
The birds and beasts will be asked
to send messages to the sect.

684
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,440
Then Nian Baiyu can check it out for us
in Scripture Hall

685
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,800
and send the weapon for us.

686
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,440
I remember it was on a bookshelf around.

687
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,760
Look at that!

688
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,190
Isn't it the book they're looking for?

689
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,550
Ye Mei, Ye Mei.

690
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,590
That's it.

691
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,110
Ye Mei has a good nose.

692
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,960
She can get what people fear and love
with her nose.

693
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,960
She is sharp-nosed,

694
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,150
so she will fear strong smells.

695
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,400
We can pour spell water along the way

696
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,320
to limit the area she can walk.

697
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,710
You are so careless!

698
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,630
Sorry, so sorry.

699
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,000
You can deploy the red silk
from Lingting country

700
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,360
along the way she'll pass by.

701
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,110
The red silk will be on Ye Mei's body
and can't be got rid of.

702
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,230
Then the tracker will follow it to find her.

703
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,960
She prefers the well-dressed young people
who are alone.

704
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,760
and will become the one they scare or love.

705
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,550
She lures people into the fantasy
she creates,

706
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,880
sucking their brains
when they fear the most.

707
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,630
The one you love?

708
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,630
Don't get the meaningless part.

709
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,400
Then the three of us will split up.

710
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,800
Waiting in the streets
where spell water isn't spilled.

711
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,110
There's a three-way road
with only one exit in the capital.

712
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,590
I will guard the exit.

713
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,960
-I can make sure she has nowhere to go.
-Good wine.

714
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,840
That's a good idea.

715
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,510
One of us can wait for
Ye Mei to arrive in the end.

716
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,360
[The Descent of Phoenix]

717
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,590
A good couple loves each other?

718
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,840
It's not as pleasant as this wine.

719
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,820
[The Descent of Phoenix]

720
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,150
God bless…

721
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,550
Please bless anything go right.

722
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,710
That's the only property I've got.

723
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,590
Please don't ruin it all.

724
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,590
[Beauty,]

725
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,760
[go to sleep now.]

726
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,510
[Tell me what you love]

727
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,630
[and what you fear.]

728
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,510
[Remember to hold the other two for a while,]

729
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,230
[not making spoil our plan.]

730
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,880
[Don't worry, Si Ying.]

731
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,440
[I'll get right on it.]

732
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,190
What is this?

733
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,230
How come I can't get it off?

734
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,230
Hi girl,

735
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,590
it's late at night.

736
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,440
Why are you here alone?

737
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,400
Girl?

738
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,070
Why are you…?

739
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,550
Darling,

740
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,480
you are here.

741
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,360
What?

742
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,440
It's only a short time away,

743
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,480
but you miss me a lot?

744
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,590
[Damn it!]

745
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,230
[I wonder if everything goes well]

746
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,110
[about them.]

747
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,630
You're Ye Mei.

748
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,670
Wait.

749
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,550
Don't kill me.

750
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,110
I won't kill you.

751
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,710
You will be handed over to Emperor Jing.

752
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,550
He will judge your guilt.

753
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,230
Sect Brother,

754
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,670
I have seen

755
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,000
the girl you love.

756
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,550
Do you want to know about her?

757
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,510
You grew up together.

758
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,150
It's you who took care of her

759
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,320
and read and cultivated with her.

760
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,230
You've waited for her for ten years.

761
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,000
Even your master thinks

762
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,230
you're a man worthy of loving.

763
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,150
Demonic words.

764
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,800
I love her

765
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,360
and this has nothing to do with anyone.

766
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,280
I don't care who she loves

767
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,320
and who loves her.

768
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,230
Seize!

769
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,070
Gongye Jiwu,

770
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,590
are you really

771
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,840
not curious about it at all?

772
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,110
Cang Jiumin had married her,

773
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,360
sleeping with her.

774
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,000
Your favorite Sect Sister

775
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,400
is married.

776
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,150
She doesn't love you

777
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,280
but the other one.

778
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,150
She's married to someone else.

779
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,920
She doesn't belong to you.

780
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,510
She doesn't belong to you!

781
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,480
Gongye Jiwu,

782
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,190
you're lucky this time.

783
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,550
[How does this happen?]

784
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,800
[It's you.]

785
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,230
[There are signs of a fight here.]

786
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,590
[Oh, no. Susu.]

787
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,000
Si Ying,

788
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,190
I underestimated the power
of the devil fetus.

789
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,000
And Mo Nv suddenly…

790
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,510
You are such a disappointment to me.

791
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,230
You can't handle the devil fetus.

792
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
You can't even control Gongye Jiwu.

793
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,150
Get up.

794
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:19,920
Listen up.

795
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,550
Our target today is the devil fetus.

796
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,880
Nothing else matters.

797
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,960
I need you

798
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,110
go back

799
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,670
to his divine lover's dream.

800
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:33,190
And see what the weakness of him is.

801
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,760
It's the Water-splashing Festival.

802
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,440
What place is this?

803
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,030
Why are we here?

804
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,760
You've brought me here.

805
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,840
Look! How lively it is!

806
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,000
Me?

807
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,030
Bravo!

808
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,920
Why are they wearing masks?

809
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,150
It turns out
this is the Water-splashing Festival.

810
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,800
[Where is he going?]

811
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,360
[Tantai Jin?]

812
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,510
[So…]

813
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,070
[It's me.]

814
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,440
These are

815
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,760
the irresistible weakness
of the devil fetus.

816
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,670
Just convince the devil fetus to believe

817
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,710
that Devil God is his inescapable destiny.

818
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,760
Si Ying,

819
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,590
you will get what you want

820
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,590
and control the devil fetus as you wish.

821
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,510
That's interesting finally.

822
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,230
Go and give a big present
to the devil fetus.

823
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,480
[How could I be here?]

824
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,710
[This is the Barren Abys.]

825
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,400
[How come I get back here again?]

826
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,510
Devil God,

827
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,960
it's you again.

828
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,190
What do you bring me here for?

829
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,960
What do I want?

830
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,760
I'm gonna ask you.

831
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,440
Born as a devil fetus,

832
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,550
but you think
you're the God of War, Ming Ye.

833
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,800
Keep my look in mind.

834
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,920
This is the only look you'll ever be.

835
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,110
Wrong!

836
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,800
I used to be a devil fetus.

837
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,030
But now

838
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,840
I am Cang Jiumin,
a disciple of the immortal sect.

839
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,070
If you don't mention it,

840
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,670
I've almost forgotten about it.

841
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,280
Will your fellow disciples

842
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,190
accept you in the immortal sect?

843
00:48:58,590 --> 00:48:59,880
What does this do

844
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,630
with you?

845
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,150
So stupid!

846
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,320
A wolf has to be in sheep's clothing.

847
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,630
Hidden among the sheep,

848
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,480
are you willing to join the immortal sect
just for her?

849
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,800
Look. There she is.

850
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,960
[Tantai Jin.]

851
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,030
[It's all over.]

852
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,150
[You can take off your mask now.]

853
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,000
[You didn't expect it, right?]

854
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,590
[It's me.]

855
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,920
[Tantai Jin.]

856
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,960
All-in-Distress Way lasts forever.

857
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,550
[Do you think, by tricking my affection,]

858
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,230
[you can save the lives
of the Three Realms?]

859
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,630
[Ridiculous!]

860
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,030
[Have you seen it?]

861
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,440
[Remember the face that scares you.]

862
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,920
[That's who I am.]

863
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,800
[No, that's not true.]

864
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,760
[This is a dream created by Devil God.]

865
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,070
Tantai Jin, you can only be me.

866
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,070
[Susu is in danger.]

867
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,360
[I have to go to save her.]

868
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,150
[It turns out]

869
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,440
[that you ]

870
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,880
[always]

871
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,550
[fear me.]

872
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:42,800
Jing Mie,

873
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,800
what are you hiding here for?

874
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,230
Do you get ready for

875
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,030
the thing I asked you to do?

876
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,320
I walked around just now.

877
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,590
It's a lively place here
on Water-splashing Festival.

878
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,280
It's a pity to ruin it.

879
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:53,760
A pity?

880
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,920
The festival means a lot

881
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,150
to the devil fetus.

882
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Only this place

883
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,510
can make him realize who he is.

884
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,800
Yes, yes.

885
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,710
What's this?

886
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,030
This one is me.

887
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,400
The other one is you.

888
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,070
Legend has it
that burning the doll of us together,

889
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,190
evil spirits and disasters
can be warded off.

890
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,400
Isn't the earthly custom

891
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,070
interesting?

892
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,920
Wouldn't you be like those mortals

893
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,550
having meaningless affection,
would you?

894
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,800
Remember.
Our only task is about the devil fetus.

895
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,760
After five hundred years,

896
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,230
Water-splashing Festival
looks as lively as ever.

897
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,110
Don't worry.

898
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,000
The nightmare is over.

899
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,510
No Devil God will appear at the festival.

900
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:46,880
So…

901
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,280
Is the devil yesterday…

902
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,150
So I'm still the one
you're most afraid of.

903
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,670
No.

904
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,000
I believe what you say.

905
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:00,880
You're not him.

906
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,030
You will never become

907
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,360
that awful look.

908
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,440
How do you know I mustn't be him?

909
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,150
You would never hurt me.

910
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,880
You wouldn't do it before.

911
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,320
And it's even less likely now.

912
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,510
You used to be Tantai Jin.

913
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,360
Now you are Cang Jiumin,

914
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,710
the most kind-hearted disciple

915
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,670
of Xiaoyao Sect.

916
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,960
You are not him.

917
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,320
Nor will you become him.

918
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,480

919
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:31,920

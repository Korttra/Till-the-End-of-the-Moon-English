00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,360
Let's not forget Jin,
my unfaithful husband.

168
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,910
He, too, has fallen prey to your charm.

169
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,240
Since he loves
being the center of attention,

170
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,480
well, wish granted.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,120
And if he do die in the process,

172
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,480
all there is to do is fill Grandmother in.

173
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,510
Know what?
I'm just going to level with you.

174
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,480
Jin is in his last days of life.

175
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,030
There's nothing you can do to change that.

176
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,150
And with the two of you gone,

177
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm sure Prince Lin will like me.

178
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,840
Oh, what a heartless, wicked woman.

179
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,000
Someone's coming.

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,240
Hmm.

181
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
Why there are crows
flying around the house all the time?

182
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,080
This is a bad omen.

183
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,120
This has always been the case
since Mr. Tantai's arrival.

184
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,720
[The sun has set again.]

185
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,510
[It's the dead of winter.]

186
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,720
[If he stays out there much longer,]

187
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,750
[he may not live to see tomorrow.]

188
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,960
[As much as he deserves it,]

189
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,320
[I can't risk
having the evil bone come back.]

190
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
[Or there'll be hell to pay.]

191
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
Ah, Mr. Tantai,

192
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,630
I'm terribly sorry.

193
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,750
I didn't see you there.

194
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,360
Yeah,

195
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
we didn't mean to get your clothes wet.

196
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,150
Come on, let's go.

197
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,320
[It's freezing cold out there.]

198
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,910
[He is just a mortal man.]

199
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,270
[And with his clothes wet through,]

200
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
[he's not going to make it.]

201
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,030
It's cold out here,

202
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,790
Xiwu.

203
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,480
Go back inside.

204
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,440
No need for you
to come and watch me suffer.

205
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,360
Well, I didn't come here for that.

206
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,510
I just…

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,030
I just…

208
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,120
Just what?

209
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
I just wanted to check if you were dead.

210
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,030
I would hate to collect your corpse.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,120
I am so sure
you don't need to do it yourself,

212
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,550
even if I die.

213
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,790
Many in this world want me dead.

214
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,670
Probably more than I care to admit.

215
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,790
They might even flood in here

216
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,200
to congratulate you on my death.

217
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,320
You don't actually think

218
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,790
those words are going to
make me go soft on you, do you?

219
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,120
Go soft on me?

220
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,870
[Goodness,]

221
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,630
[he's in bad shape.]

222
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,360
[He's not going to make it
if this doesn’t stop.]

223
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,630
[Screw it.]

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
[You are not going to
get away like this.]

225
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
Boy, this cloak is ugly.

226
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm not wearing it.

227
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,030
You can have it.

228
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,000
I couldn't, possibly.

229
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,510
It's yours.

230
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,030
But if you don't like it,

231
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
You may have Chuntao
get rid of it tomorrow.

232
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,030
You…

233
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,790
Will there be anything else?

234
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,440
[See, Li Susu?]

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,790
[He is not a creature
made of flesh and bone.]

236
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,320
[You expressed sympathy for him.]

237
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,720
[Yet he was sarcastically
mean to you in return.]

238
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,790
[He doesn't deserve your kindness.]

239
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,360
[Not while he's still breathing.]

240
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
[So save the empathy,]

241
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
[and do something meaningful.]

242
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,440
[Patience is the key to success.]

243
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,360
[No doubt Jin is worthy of death,]

244
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,600
[but he is the key to the future of]

245
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,360
[the Four Continents and Three Realms.]

246
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,200
Jin, hey.

247
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Drop the act.

248
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,840
It's not going to
make me feel bad for you.

249
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
[Why do I feel like
I've been here and done this before?]

250
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,550
[Is this where he died]

251
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,960
[and morphed into a demon?]

252
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,270
Jin! Jin!

253
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,550
Wake up!

254
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,720
Chuntao!

255
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,150
Chuntao!

256
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,440
Miss Xiwu,

257
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,200
are you asking for me?

258
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,750
I am, yes! Come in, quick!

259
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,000
Miss Xiwu,

260
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,630
is this a dream?
Or are you not right in the head?

261
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,320
What are you talking about?

262
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,240
Go boil some water! Quick!

263
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,030
He's dying!

264
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,720
Go!

265
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,320
Miss Xiwu,

266
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,200
why were you
and Mr. Tantai clinging together?

267
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,120
Well, we are a married couple.

268
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,000
Isn't that what
human husbands and wives do?

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,910
Sleeping together in the same bed?

270
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,150
Human?

271
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,720
Go check the water temperature.

272
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,910
Absolutely.

273
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,120
It's comfortably warm, Miss Xiwu.

274
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,720
All right, Chuntao, you're dismissed.

275
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,960
Yes, Miss Xiwu.

276
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,320
[Did Xiwu do all this to him?]

277
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,200
[If I had known he was this fragile,]

278
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,670
[I wouldn't have put the future of]

279
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,390
[the Four Continents
and Three Realms at stake]

280
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,120
[just to get even with him.]

281
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,910
[Come on, Jin.]

282
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,840
[Please. You're a Devil God.]

283
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,870
[Don't die. Think about
the Four Continents and Three Realms.]

284
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,080
Tantai Jin, you poor, poor man.

285
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,360
It's you again.

286
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,550
You're always there

287
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
whenever death comes knocking.

288
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,750
I never left.

289
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,320
I know.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,630
You're inside of me.

291
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,670
Do you want it?

292
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,390
Not yet. Now is not the time.

293
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
Then when is it?

294
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,030
Why? You've run out of patience?

295
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,080
But I don't blame you.

296
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,910
For the past 20 years and more,

297
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,630
this body has done nothing
but make you feel pain,

298
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,440
hungry, cold, and humiliated.

299
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,960
And made you helpless.

300
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,080
One of these days,
you'll be free from the flesh.

301
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,270
And you will offer me your soul

302
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,750
and find eternal peace.

303
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,240
It doesn't matter.

304
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,630
My body,

305
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,630
and my soul,

306
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
you can have both

307
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,480
if you like.

308
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,550
I couldn't care less.

309
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,910
You have to be
a bit more patient, Tantai Jin.

310
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,790
You're going to
go through all hardships of mortal life.

311
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,840
And be drowned in endless bitterness.

312
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,030
You'll walk a dark and cursed path.

313
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,790
There's no escaping the pain.

314
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,510
And when you’re in your hardest time

315
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,480
and approach the end of life,

316
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,840
I will come for you
and accept your offerings.

317
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,350
[The moon 500 years ago]

318
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,240
[shone so much brighter.]

319
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,750
[Such a shame that
the Devil God has descended,]

320
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,110
[throwing a blanket of
foul fog over the Earth.]

321
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,880
[I haven't seen the moon
for… God knows how long.]

322
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,000
[Born from an evil origin,
with an evil bone in him.]

323
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,350
[Where is that bone located?]

324
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,550
[How does it look like?]

325
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,750
[I wonder which of these is the evil one.]

326
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,480
[Hmm, they all feel pretty normal to me.]

327
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
What are you doing?

328
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,480
You're awake.

329
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,400
Xiwu,

330
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,030
what game are you playing this time?

331
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,350
It doesn't concern you.

332
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,790
Now that you're up,
don't soak in there pretending to be dead.

333
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,640
Go get dressed at once.

334
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,510
Where are you going?

335
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,880
To the lake.

336
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,110
It's still dark outside.

337
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,680
No, don't go.

338
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,550
Stop right there.

339
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,200
You're not going to the lake.

340
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,960
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

341
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,440
Why?

342
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,880
You're my husband.

343
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,270
You were kneeling out there
with many people passing by.

344
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,640
It's only going to embarrass me.

345
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,550
Well, I'm sorry.

346
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,750
I'm tired. I'm going to get some sleep.

347
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,880
Don't talk to me.

348
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,350
[Father,]

349
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,480
[I guess you didn't expect
I would be sleeping with the Devil God]

350
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,960
[when you sent me here.]

351
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,270
Why are you standing over there?

352
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,790
Do it.

353
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,000
I want to get it over with
and then go to bed.

354
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,880
Do what?

355
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,270
Things that you do to me
every night, of course.

356
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,830
Have you forgotten?

357
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,350
[Shoot.]

358
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,310
[He can't find out who I really am.]

359
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,550
Oh please.

360
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,110
How could I forget?

361
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,350
Hang on. I'm a little parched.

362
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,030
Chuntao,

363
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,270
get me some tea.

364
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,440
Chuntao, help me remember.

365
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,680
What exactly is the thing

366
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,550
Jin and I do every night?

367
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,920
You beat him.

368
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,960
You have become rather moody

369
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,270
after marrying him.

370
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,640
And you whip him every night before bed

371
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,110
as an outlet for your anger.

372
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,310
What is she, a psychopath?

373
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Where's the whip?

374
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,920
Under your mattress, Miss Xiwu.

375
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,070
[And how many times?]

376
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
[Well,]

377
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,720
[I guess it depends on your mood.]

378
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,830
[This is a long whip.]

379
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,680
[Geez, Xiwu does have a twisted mind.]

380
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,720
[Li Susu,]

381
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
[you can do this, right?]

382
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,240
[You used to slay demons
without even blinking an eye.]

383
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,550
[This is for that Devil God]

384
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,640
[you'll be turning into in 500 years.]

385
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,160
[Oh, Devil God,]

386
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,830
[you deserve this.]

387
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,590
[Li Susu,]

388
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,200
[what are you doing?]

389
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,510
[He is not yet a Devil God.]

390
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,030
[All these beatings and insults,]

391
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,270
[all the bullying and the torture,]

392
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,480
[that can't stop
the Devil God from coming to Earth.]

393
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,160
[What it really does is]

394
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,070
[making you feel worse.]

395
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,790
I'm tired.

396
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,270
I'm going to call it a night…

397
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,110
and off to bed.

398
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,310
Jin.

399
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,830
Jin?

400
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,400
Jin.

401
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,070
Jin!

402
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,310
Jin!

403
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,480
[He's burning up.]

404
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,070
[Oh dear.]

405
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,680
[He knelt in the snow for days,]

406
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,240
[and he was beaten up.]

407
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,240
[All too much for a mortal like him.]

408
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,960
[Li Susu, oh, Li Susu,]

409
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,270
[what have you done?]

410
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,400
Chuntao!

411
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,680
Chuntao!

412
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
Are you awake?

413
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,960
Chuntao!

414
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,750
Miss Xiwu,

415
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,310
the potion is ready.

416
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,720
Anything else before I go?

417
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,960
No, that's it.

418
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,720
I mean it this time, Chuntao.

419
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,750
Go back to bed.

420
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,030
Jin.

421
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,310
Jin.

422
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,160
Here, drink this.

423
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,270
[He's fuzzy with a fever.]

424
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,680
[And I'm not even sure
if these herbs from Earth work.]

425
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,160
Open your mouth.

426
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,400
His temperature isn't going down.

427
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,240
[Father would place
a cool washcloth on my forehead]

428
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,830
[every time I had a fever as a kid.]

429
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,270
You're finally awake.

430
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,070
I knew this would work.

431
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,310
All right now,

432
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,590
you get some rest.

433
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,070
I'm going to go to bed.

434
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,590
Seriously, what did I do to deserve this?

435
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,400
[She's a different person ever since
she comes back from the temple.]

436
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,510
[Is she got possessed]

437
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,480
[by some evil spirit or something?]

438
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,540
[Ye's Mansion]

439
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,070
Miss Xiwu,

440
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,590
you should have slept in a bit.

441
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,070
You stayed up late last night.

442
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,790
Where's Jin?

443
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,310
Apart from getting corporal punishment,

444
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,350
a typical day in his life also involves
copying sutras in the Librarium.

445
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,920
He's probably been there
since this morning.

446
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,960
[Jin,]

447
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,920
[you owe me a life debt
that you can't get out of.]

448
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,310
[Someday, you'll pay with your life.]

449
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,200
[Bear that in mind.]

450
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,830
What time is it?

451
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,920
Almost noon.

452
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,830
Mrs. Ye, Mr. Ye, and Mr. Zeyu,

453
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,030
they're waiting in the dining room.

454
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,550
Miss Xiwu.

455
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,720
[So these are Xiwu's family,]

456
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,880
[who she sees every day.]

457
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,110
[If I want to stay here,]

458
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,550
[I'll need to get through this first.]

459
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,400
[This must be Xiwu's father,]

460
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,480
[the Sheng's
Pillar of the State Great General.]

461
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,350
[And this must be Zeyu,]

462
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,590
[Xiwu's eldest brother.]

463
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,550
[As for these women,]

464
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,510
[They may be concubines of Xiwu's father.]

465
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,720
[This old lady
dressed in strikingly luxurious clothes,]

466
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,310
[she's got to be Xiwu's grandmother.]

467
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,880
Grandmother.

468
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,200
What's with you, Xiwu?

469
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,830
Don't look at Chuntao.

470
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,240
Unless you want her to be punished too.

471
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,240
[Geez.]

472
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,790
[Xiwu is such a trouble magnet.]

473
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,070
[What she had done this time?]

474
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,590
Come here.

475
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,070
[Oh gosh, please
don't cane me on my palm.]

476
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,440
What in God's name are you thinking,

477
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,960
walking around

478
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,440
without a windbreaker

479
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,550
in the dead of winter?

480
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,590
Look at her.

481
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,960
She’s hardly wearing anything.

482
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Oh, my poor darling.

483
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,400
You are surrounded

484
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,590
by a bunch of incompetent people.

485
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,960
At the end of the day,
family is all you have.

486
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,590
Here.

487
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,240
Wear this. It'll keep you warm.

488
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,270
[Whew, I thought
I was going to get punished.]

489
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,920
Now this is so much better.

490
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,030
Chuntao,

491
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,880
fetch some pelts from the storage room.

492
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,590
Xiwu could use a couple more coats.

493
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,270
Certainly.

494
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,240
Grandmother,

495
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,070
I'd love a white fox fur coat, too.

496
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,350
Oh,

497
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,960
ask your father for it.

498
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,510
Father, can I have
a white fox fur coat made?

499
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,070
In your dreams.

500
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,590
Have you no shame,

501
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,790
Zeyu?

502
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,350
As my eldest son,

503
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,880
you are supposed to train to fight.

504
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,270
Guard the borders
and contribute to the country

505
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,680
as your younger brother does.

506
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,790
Instead, you mess about with your gang.

507
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,070
Wasting your time on having fun.

508
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,750
Look at you.

509
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,440
No decent girl
in the capital would fall for you.

510
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,480
[That's harsh.]
The food's getting cold.

511
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,480
Let's just eat.

512
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Buttercup,

513
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,030
go sit by your father.

514
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,030
Go.

515
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,590
All right.

516
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,440
Easy.

517
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,510
Father.

518
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,070
Xiwu, honey,

519
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,550
try this.

520
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,200
I know you haven't been
in a good mood lately.

521
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
I specifically ordered the kitchen staff

522
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,270
to make your favorite dishes.

523
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,030
I have been told by the helpers that

524
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,200
you were up all night last night,

525
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
steeping in a hot bath and brewing potion.

526
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
You must be tired

527
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,720
after a sleepless night.

528
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,240
You must eat more to fuel up.

529
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,550
Right, here you go.

530
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,070
Here, have some more.

531
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,590
You need more protein in your diet.

532
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,070
Eat this.

533
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,350
Don't take that personally.

534
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,960
[So…]

535
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
And this, too.

536
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,440
[this is family love,
as described in the book.]

537
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,160
These dishes were made especially for you.

538
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,270
They're all your favorite foods.

539
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,590
[Father,]

540
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,480
[these people are good to me.]

541
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
The tofu soup is amazing.

542
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,030
[The same as you are.]

543
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,310
I understand from
the Marchioness of Order yesterday that

544
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,590
everyone in the capital is talking about

545
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,310
how Xiwu pushed Bingchang into the water.

546
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,200
The news spread far and wide.

547
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,200
People can talk all they want about Xiwu.
Words can't hurt.

548
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
It'll harm her reputation.

549
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,590
What's done cannot be undone.

550
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,750
Plus, Xiwu's already married.

551
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,590
But Father,

552
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,750
before Xiwu got married last year,

553
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,640
you said she should be
allowed some harmless fun.

554
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,720
And that she would have to
take responsibility for her behavior

555
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,200
after marriage.

556
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
And now this.

557
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,590
How is she always right?

558
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,200
Keep quiet.

559
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,240
Eat your food.

560
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,590
[Xiwu, oh, Xiwu,]

561
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,510
[now I know why]

562
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,200
[you are such a spoiled brat.]

563
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,880
Actually, I've given it a lot of thought.

564
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,790
I shouldn't have pushed
Bingchang into the lake.

565
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,960
It's my fault.

566
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,550
I’d like to pay her a visit today
and ask for her forgiveness.

567
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,680
Mother,

568
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,240
are you hearing this?

569
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,240
Oh, isn't Xiwu thoughtful?

570
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,880
[He calls this thoughtful?]
Well…

571
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,590
Xiwu's always been kind and dependable.

572
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,920
Absolutely worthy
of being called my granddaughter.

573
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,240
[These people really spoil her rotten.]

574
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,350
You can skip the niceties, though.

575
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,880
What if Bingchang's cold hasn't gone away?

576
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,830
We wouldn't want you

577
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,720
to catch it.

578
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,880
It's okay, Grandmother.

579
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,750
I agree with you, Grandmother.

580
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,350
If Xiwu did make an apology,

581
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,000
then she'd be underestimating
the bond of our sisterhood.

582
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,590
Bingchang.

583
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Sit, Xiwu.

584
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,440
I'm sorry,

585
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,480
Grandmother.

586
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,880
I haven't felt well enough

587
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,790
to greet you and Father
for the past few days.

588
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,830
And I must also
apologize for interrupting the meal.

589
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,310
I didn't think it would take me so long

590
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,720
to get freshened up
after giving out porridge to the needy.

591
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,750
You heard her,

592
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,880
Xiwu.

593
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,590
No apology is needed.

594
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,590
Bingchang,

595
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,480
sit next to Zeyu.

596
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,070
Yes, Grandmother.

597
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,710
[No wonder Gong…]

598
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,840
[I mean,]

599
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,320
[both Prince Lin
and Jin have a thing for her.]

600
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,230
[She's beautiful.]

601
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,760
[She's gentle. And she has a kind soul.]

602
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,710
[Nobody could ever hate her.]

603
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,510
I don't see Jin.

604
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,630
Why isn't he here eating with us?

605
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,710
Do you honestly think
you're one of the employers here?

606
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,800
You eat the food,
yet you don't help with anything.

607
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,550
Yeah, you can't just do nothing all day.

608
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,880
What do you want?

609
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,880
What do I want?

610
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,550
Well,

611
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,190
the boys and I
have spent the afternoon doing chores.

612
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,280
There's a pile of dirty dishes over there,

613
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,230
all used by the family.

614
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,880
I see you laze around all the time.

615
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,230
So do me a favor

616
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,920
and wash those dishes before you eat.

617
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,840
-Is that okay?
-Mm.

618
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,590
That's right.

619
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,590
Thank you, Mr. Tantai.

620
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,440
Go on, Mr. Tantai.

621
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,030
Go.

622
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,320
Thanks a bunch.

623
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,550
Come on, guys.

624
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Time for lunch.

625
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,440
Come on over. It's lunchtime.

626
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,360
Yeah, coming.

627
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,440
Get me a bowl of rice.

628
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,150
Hey, pass the pot over here.

629
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,920
Nope, I'll help myself.

630
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,360
Here you go.

631
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,070
Yeah, all right.

632
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,710
Ugh.

633
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,280
There.

634
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,150
Here you are.

635
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,760
So Jin has never joined us at the table

636
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,510
ever since he came here.

637
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,510
He has his meals
with the helpers in the kitchen.

638
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,960
Mm-hmm.

639
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,590
You hate his guts.

640
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,710
Having him around ruins your appetite.

641
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,670
And from what I hear,

642
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,880
He isn't getting enough food.

643
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,760
The helpers in the kitchen
take their cue from you.

644
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,510
They watch what you do,

645
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,030
and they imitate.

646
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,480
[Well, severs him right.]

647
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,440
[He's a devil after all.]

648
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,590
[But he's been
keeping his distance from me.]

649
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,070
[I can hardly keep an eye on him.]

650
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,190
Where is the kitchen?

651
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,440
Let me tell you something.

652
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,590
Some people…

653
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,360
may seem to be in a higher social class.

654
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,840
But deep down, they are inferior.

655
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,480
That's so true.

656
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,440
It's… what do you call it again?

657
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,000
A broken-down noble.

658
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,320
A broken-down noble.

659
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,510
Even we are living
better lives than he is,

660
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,110
aren't we?

661
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,110
That's right.

662
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,230
Guys, let's dig in.

663
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:55,800
Yeah, come on.

664
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,550
Go on, eat your food.

665
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,230
This smells so good.

666
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,000
Mmm, yum.

667
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,070
I'm not going to lie.

668
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,590
His life is absolutely pathetic.

669
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,960
He may as well take his own life
and free himself from all these miseries.

670
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,800
[So Xiwu has been encouraging]

671
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,440
[the helpers]

672
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,710
[to treat Jin like a doormat, huh?]

673
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,190
I couldn't agree more.

674
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,360
He should just end his miserable life.

675
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,670
Go.

676
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,070
Yum.

677
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,960
There's a fly buzzing around.

678
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Where did it come from? It's winter.

679
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,760
What's wrong?

680
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,030
Are you okay?

681
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,070
Have some water.

682
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,710
Are you all right?

683
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,550
Is everything okay?

684
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,190
I just swallowed that fly.

685
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
I can't eat anymore.
You guys go on without me.

686
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,590
I'm leaving too.

687
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,710
-You guys just eat.
-Let's continue the meal.

688
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,630
Come sit right here.

689
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,070
Done for the day.

690
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,920
Guess this isn't my lucky day.

691
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,440
Come on.

692
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,710
Miss Xiwu.

693
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,230
-Miss Xiwu.
-What brings you here?

694
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,800
Um, Mr. Tantai is…

695
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,400
Tell me. What did Jin have to do

696
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,960
to be told to kill himself?

697
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,400
Uh, Miss Xiwu,

698
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,480
I put Mr. Tantai on dish duty.

699
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,590
In the bucket were chunks of ice

700
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,480
that we collected
from the frozen lake last night.

701
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,110
Oh, by the way,

702
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,960
I spilled icy cold water
on him while I was at it.

703
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,230
Too bad he survived the freezing cold.

704
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,030
I'll make sure
his hands are in the ice water

705
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,030
long enough to lose his fingers.

706
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
And we didn't save him any food today.

707
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,360
Only a bucket of swill.

708
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
So this is how poorly

709
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,440
you people have been treating him?

710
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,760
Human beings are all equal.

711
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,000
But some prefer to stoop low

712
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,320
and be stuck in service.

713
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,510
And to feel good about themselves,

714
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,590
they walk all over people
who are weaker than them.

715
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,360
Do you seriously take pleasure

716
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,590
in watching people struggle?

717
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,230
Miss Xiwu, you're
taking this a little bit too seriously.

718
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,800
We were just trying to avenge you on him.

719
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,710
You have our absolute loyalty.

720
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,030
You've been utterly rude to Jin

721
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,920
because you know he's alone and unaided.

722
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,510
If the Ye Family
were no longer prosperous one day,

723
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,630
you would do the same to my family and me,

724
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,670
wouldn't you?

725
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,670
Oh, no, no.

726
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,230
Absolutely not, Miss Xiwu.

727
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,590
I'm sorry, Miss Xiwu.

728
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,710
Please forgive us.

729
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,880
Please forgive me, Miss Xiwu.

730
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,480
-We're terribly sorry.
-Please forgive us.

731
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,710
Forgive us, Miss Xiwu.

732
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,840
Do not eat that.

733
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,800
Well…

734
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,000
One would be dead without any food.

735
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,880
It's awfully dirty.

736
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,840
Only God knows

737
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,070
what those helpers have added to it.

738
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,360
It'll make you sick.

739
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,800
I've eaten far worse.

740
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,550
Why didn't you defend yourself

741
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,480
when they said those things to you?

742
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,920
Why would you, a prince of a kingdom,
let people push you around?

743
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,000
Don't you have any dignity?

744
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,760
Dignity?

745
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,710
It means nothing to me.

746
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,030
For me, personally,

747
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,320
this bowl of rice matters more.

748
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,000
Xiwu!

749
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,110
Come with me.

750
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,840
I cannot survive without food.

751
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,920
But if I had had dignity,

752
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,480
I would have died long ago.

753
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,150
Shut it. You're coming with me.

754
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,190
Eat this.

755
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,880
And I'll let you go.

756
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,360
You're too skinny and physically weak.

757
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,110
Even flu can kill you.

758
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,510
Now you're pulling

759
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,760
the same trick twice.

760
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,710
I'd be a fool to trust you again.

761
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,710
Now, if you'll excuse me.

762
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,190
Sit down.

763
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,880
What trick?

764
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
Make yourself clear.

765
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,960
You asked if I had dignity.

766
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,440
The truth is,

767
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,880
I don’t think you
have such a thing, either.

768
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,230
You want me to repeat myself?

769
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,280
Fine.

770
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,030
I'll say it again.

771
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,800
I'm listening.

772
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,030
Your sister Bingchang
met up with Prince Lin

773
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,320
at the royal feast six months ago.

774
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,110
They were roaming around
the garden hand in hand.

775
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,960
And you,

776
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,840
you were desperate to break them up

777
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,110
so you could have Prince Lin your man.

778
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,670
You got this tranquilizer

779
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,030
called Love Fury.

780
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,360
You were going to drug Bingchang

781
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,960
and Prince Liang,

782
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,150
hoping they would
sleep together under the influence.

783
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,150
[Unexpectedly, Prince Liang cornered me]
Prince Liang.

784
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,920
That was quite a feast.

785
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,190
Even the maids and the eunuchs
can have some exquisite food.

786
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,110
You got nothing to eat tonight, did you?

787
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,920
Lucky for you,

788
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,880
I have a big heart.

789
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,590
Have a pastry.

790
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,590
Thank you, Your Highness.

791
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,110
Oops.

792
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,590
I don't know if you've heard,

793
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,030
but my country and yours are at war.

794
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,320
If anyone reminded
my father of your existence,

795
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,480
he might just have you beheaded
as a sacrifice for gods before a battle.

796
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,670
This might happen, right?

797
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,840
I've just remembered.

798
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,480
You like foods broken into smaller parts.

799
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,880
Small enough?

800
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,550
Mm-hmm.

801
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,230
[Next thing I knew,]

802
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,150
[was my head started spinning.]

803
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,760
[Then you came out of nowhere
and wrapped your arms around me.]

804
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,880
[I ate the drug-laced food
meant for Prince Liang by accident.]

805
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,480
[Oddly enough,]

806
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,630
[the one meant for Bingchang]

807
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,920
[was eaten by you for
all the wrong reasons.]

808
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,030
[Many in the palace
knew about that night.]

809
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,000
[Your father had no choice
but to arrange for us to tie the knot.]

810
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,880
To celebrate the love between
the Pillar of the State Great General's daughter,

811
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:42,000
Ye Xiwu, and the third Prince
of Jing Kingdom, Tantai Jin,

812
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,920
a marriage has been bestowed upon them.

813
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,000
Then one day, you told me the whole story.

814
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:58,320
Since that point in time…

815
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,670
you've been mocking
and torturing me just for fun.

816
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,030
And you've become
increasingly twisted and cruel.

817
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,800
[Geez, Xiwu.]

818
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,400
[You are unbelievable.]

819
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,280
So, Miss Xiwu,

820
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,710
what did you do

821
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,480
to my food this time?

822
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,320
Nothing.

823
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,400
Really?

824
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,480
You're doing all this

825
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,070
just to make sure I have enough to eat?

826
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,510
I see nothing wrong with that.

827
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,440
Let me tell you something.

828
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,190
Don't even think about
starving yourself to death.

829
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,630
I won't let that happen.

830
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,280
Now watch me.

831
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,400
You happy now?

832
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,440
From today on, you will
have all of your meals here.

833
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,710
Chuntao will bring food to you.

834
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,440
And you will eat
whatever she puts before you.

835
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,000
Don't you ever eat disgusting,

836
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,440
straight-up nasty food scraps again.

837
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,400
[This rice
does seem like it's safe to eat.]

838
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,710
[What's gotten into her, really?]

839
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,280
Guessing this is the first time

840
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,070
you've had a square meal
here at the Ye's Mansion.

841
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,030
Have you noticed that

842
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,320
that broad's a little too sane these days?

843
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,000
Does she have a loose screw, or what?

844
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,670
Well,

845
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,960
Maybe she's come up with other ways

846
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,590
to play her twisted games.

847
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,440
They have me.

848
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,360
If I die...

849
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,840
let's just say

850
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,030
they can't get away with it.

851
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,310
You are right.
She does behave unpredictably.

852
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,830
You can't stay here much longer.

853
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,670
The problem is,

854
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,560
where else can you go?

855
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,270
Oh, by the way,

856
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,270
I bumped into
a couple of crows from Jing Kingdom.

857
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,350
The Jing Kingdom…

858
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,710
I was born there.

859
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,710
What a coincidence.

860
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,390
Have you ever been to its palace?

861
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,920
It's the worst place in the world.

862
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,870
They told me…

863
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,600
they saw a shaman
performing some sort of ritual.

864
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,480
They smelled a decaying body.

865
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,750
And there were also
uptight ministers pacing the hall.

866
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,790
It must have been
because of the King of Jing.

867
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,230
The man I should have called Father…

868
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,480
is dying.

869
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,310
[I'm stuck in here.]

870
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,000
[Guess I'll just stay out of it all.]

871
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,000
Father,

872
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,600
I have something important to report.

873
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,390
Lin.

874
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,640
Your timing is perfect.

875
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,520
I've just received an urgent message.

876
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,480
Tantai Wuji is at death's door.

877
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,600
Tantai Minglang
will take the throne after him.

878
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,920
Looks like Tantai Jin

879
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,560
has outlived his usefulness.

880
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,280
From what I've been told,

881
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,160
Tantai Minglang is a ruthless man.

882
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,400
He may not even show empathy for his siblings.

883
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,870
We would be giving him
what he wants by killing Tantai Jin.

884
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,560
I knew you were a smart one.

885
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,240
Now, if I spare Tantai Jin,

886
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,810
he's going to be a pain in his brother's ass

887
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,120
for as long as he's alive.

888
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:30,370
I'm going to summon Tantai Jin over.

889
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,370
I want to sound out his opinion.

890
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:33,890
If he has ambitions,

891
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,890
I could get him back to Jing first

892
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,160
to muddy the waters.

893
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,450
And then have him killed amid chaos.

894
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,410
But if he is unambitious,

895
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,930
then he's of no use to me.

896
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,560
We will then send
a male of similar age to Jing

897
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,160
to trick Tantai Minglang into thinking

898
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,640
that's his brother.

899
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,400
Sometimes...

900
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,320
honesty isn't always the best policy.

901
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,680
Father…

902
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:03,470

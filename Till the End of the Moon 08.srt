I want to give you a gift.

172
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,080
Your Highness. This is too precious.

173
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,670
The steps are full of tawny daylily.

174
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,440
I've heard that people use this flower
as a metaphor for mothers.

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
I lost my mother when I was young.

176
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,960
And I have no one to give this hairpin to.

177
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,390
How about

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
you have it?

179
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,870
Here.

180
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,750
Lan'an.

181
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,120
You did your best to bring me up,

182
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,960
and made plans for me.

183
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,840
I will remember all of this.

184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,870
I wonder if my elder brother

185
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
will be surprised

186
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,240
[Memorial Tablet of Holy
Emperor of the Great Jing]

187
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,550
when he sees me.

188
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,270
Congratulations, Your Highness.

189
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,360
Tantai Minghan and his party

190
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,840
were bound by our spell

191
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,270
before they could leave the palace.

192
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,320
They were all beheaded.

193
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,550
Well done.

194
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,240
Your Highness, it's my honor

195
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,750
that you appreciate me.

196
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,390
Now, my third brother

197
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,480
is the only family I have left.

198
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
I miss him a bit, though.

199
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,910
Your Highness,

200
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,150
I brought some cooks from the Yiyue tribe.

201
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,840
They cooked some of our hometown dishes.

202
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,150
I wonder if Your Highness likes it.

203
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,270
Thank you.

204
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,390
I haven't been back for many years.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,270
What's going on in the Jing now?

206
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,790
Emperor Jing just passed away.

207
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,600
The new Emperor is Tantai Minglang.

208
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
There's one more thing.

209
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,910
I want to know what your opinion is.

210
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,840
Although Ye Xiwu is vulgar,

211
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,080
after all, she is your wife.

212
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,320
In the future,
when you return to the Jing…

213
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,670
She is not my wife.

214
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,480
Your Highness,

215
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,150
I not only brought cooks
from the Yiyue tribe,

216
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,840
but I also brought the beauties with me.

217
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,200
They can all sing and dance well.

218
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,790
Your Highness, you may enjoy it.

219
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,030
Just kill time.

220
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,480
Sure.

221
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,840
So beautiful.

222
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,440
What do you think of this?

223
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,510
Ziling.

224
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,360
Your younger brother is the head
of the Moonshadow Guards.

225
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
Did he tell you

226
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,120
what His Highness looks like?

227
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,820
-Tell us.
-Yes, tell us.

228
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,360
Please tell us.

229
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,030
Baiyu is a dummy.

230
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,480
He only cares about his duties.

231
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,000
He wouldn't tell me that.

232
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,440
But it doesn't matter
what His Highness looks like.

233
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,720
I just want to know what girls he likes!

234
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,870
Isn't that right, girls?

235
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

236
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,030
Well.

237
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,120
-Keep searching!
-What kind of girls does he like?

238
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,480
We can find her.

239
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,870
What are you guys doing here?

240
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,030
Miss Nian. We're looking for someone.

241
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,320
I wonder if you've seen

242
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,630
a young lady before.

243
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,870
Young?

244
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,790
We're all young.

245
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,000
We're young ladies.

246
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,960
Well, can we go in and search?

247
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,720
Alright, I won't make it hard for you.

248
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,000
Aunt Lan'an asks you all to perform.

249
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,510
Finally!

250
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,630
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,360
Girls, let's go.

252
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,120
Let's go.

253
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,270
Let's go.

254
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,440
[Perform?]

255
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
[Dance?]

256
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,480
[I don't know how to dance!]

257
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,790
[I can play this.]

258
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,320
[Oh no.]

259
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,200
[The harp humans use]

260
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,200
[is so different from Chongyu Harp.]

261
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,870
[Even the strings are loose.]

262
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,150
[Ye Xiwu.]

263
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,600
[How did she escape?]

264
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,240
Your Highness.

265
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,200
It's my fault.

266
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,390
Ye Xiwu has escaped.

267
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,390
Is that so?

268
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,360
I've ordered someone
to guard the dinghy closely.

269
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,720
Patrol of the Moonshadow Guards
did not see anyone jumping into the river.

270
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,550
Ye Xiwu must be on the boat.

271
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,670
Your Highness, please give the order

272
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,000
to search cabin by cabin.

273
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,080
No need.

274
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,960
Let's listen to the song first.

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,080
She can't escape.

276
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,720
[Ye Xiwu.]

277
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,120
[I'll see how long you can hold out.]

278
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,640
[Why are they still dancing?]

279
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,200
[If I keep playing,
I'm going to get caught.]

280
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,550
[Finally, I managed to muddle through.]

281
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,920
Your Highness, do you like the dance?

282
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,590
It's nice.

283
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,110
How about another solo dance?

284
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,350
Let that dancer dance.

285
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,030
Who is it? Who?

286
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,400
Who would dance before His Highness?

287
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,000
Who is it?

288
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,920
Yes.

289
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,550
The one with the harp.

290
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,160
I made a fortune telling for them.

291
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,590
Guess what?

292
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,160
Water will bring them luck.

293
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,590
It's threatening but not dangerous.

294
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,240
It's highly auspicious!

295
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,240
Highly auspicious?

296
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,640
Don't worry about it.

297
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,790
Maybe Miss Xiwu
was taken to the Jing Kingdom

298
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,750
to be their queen and enjoy her happiness!

299
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,270
If she becomes a queen
in a hostile country,

300
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm afraid our family will be

301
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,550
in even more danger in court.

302
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,310
Why did His Highness choose her to dance?

303
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,270
-Why?
-Don't know.

304
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,550
Why her?

305
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,640
[Tantai Jin!]

306
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,070
[How dare you play me like this?]

307
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,640
What?

308
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,310
You can play the harp but can't dance?

309
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,350
[I can't just sit and wait.]

310
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,030
[I must find a way to get out of here.]

311
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,480
[Tantai Jin.]

312
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,240
[You asked for it.]

313
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,030
[Don't regret it!]

314
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,790
Your Highness.

315
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,310
Your Highness.

316
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,350
Stay back.

317
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,440
Come with me.

318
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,000
Don't move, or I'll strangle him to death.

319
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,550
Miss Ye.

320
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,110
What the hell do you want?

321
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,200
Stop the boat!

322
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,200
Let us go to the dinghy.

323
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,110
When we get to the shore safely,

324
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,030
I'll let him come back here.

325
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
Don't know you want to run away so badly.

326
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,030
If you don't want to be strangled,

327
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,110
let me get into the dinghy.

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's split up there.

329
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,480
Merry meet, merry part. Alright?

330
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,640
You can't get away.

331
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,440
You are overconfident!

332
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,400
Ye Xiwu.

333
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,270
I guess you have not seen

334
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,750
how a beast hunts its prey, right?

335
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,070
Some beasts do not kill their prey

336
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,400
so easily.

337
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
They just

338
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,240
tease and torment the prey

339
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,590
until it takes its last breath.

340
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,550
Unfortunately,

341
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,750
I am not your prey.

342
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,830
Since you asked me to dance,

343
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,200
I'd make you regret your decision.

344
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,440
Let me get in the dinghy!

345
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,480
[Since you want to play,]

346
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,240
[I'll play with you to the end!]

347
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,200
Nian Baiyu!

348
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,000
This cold palace
has few visitors all year round.

349
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,440
Go to the dinghy.

350
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,070
Yes.

351
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,030
Wise decision.

352
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,160
Cut the rope.

353
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,750
Don't you dare!

354
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,550
Cut it!

355
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,240
Yes!

356
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,960
Tell him to stop, or I'll strangle you!

357
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,960
Catch her!

358
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,790
Your Highness.

359
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,240
Do you want her dead or alive?

360
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,350
It doesn't matter.

361
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,880
Yes!

362
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,750
Wait!

363
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,480
I want her alive.

364
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,270
Yes.

365
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,640
Ye Xiwu.

366
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,920
You have no other choice.

367
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,750
Just give up.

368
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,960
Go back to the Jing with me.

369
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
I'll never go back with you!

370
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,960
Didn't you say
you would kill me sooner or later?

371
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,830
You…

372
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,110
I am going to kill you.

373
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,200
But even the nonentities want to be alive.

374
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
Isn't it good to live in dishonor
for one more day?

375
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,160
Is that so?

376
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,310
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

377
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,350
It's a pity.

378
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,590
I don't want this kind of charity.

379
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,790
She jumped overboard!

380
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,440
She wanted to run away from me so much!

381
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,550
Lan'an.

382
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,750
Is she going to die?

383
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,920
Qi Shuang.

384
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,400
Yes.

385
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,350
Bring someone to look for Miss Ye.

386
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,350
Find her,

387
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,030
dead or alive.

388
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,070
Yes.

389
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,390
Father, I heard
you ordered General Ye Qingyu

390
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,630
to capture Tantai Jin.

391
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,910
I wonder…

392
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,430
if you can let me do it instead.

393
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,840
Why?

394
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,320
Forgive me for speaking frankly.

395
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,630
Tantai Jin has escaped back to his domain.

396
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,630
It is difficult to stop him.

397
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,430
But there are many powerful forces
along both sides of the river.

398
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,710
It's a complicated place.

399
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,240
It is difficult for us
to collect taxes there every year.

400
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,710
If the Dragon Guards
can inspect the states and counties

401
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,710
in the name of hunting the hostage prince

402
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,520
and check their repositories
at the same time,

403
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,560
we can punish someone
as a warning to others.

404
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,110
So, we can solve a big problem
for the Sheng.

405
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,800
My son is really smart.

406
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,390
You tried so hard.

407
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,630
You've thought out such a good idea

408
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,390
for the Ye family,
to let them atone for their faults.

409
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,430
The Ye family was negligent.

410
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,430
They are indeed guilty.

411
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,280
But the two generals

412
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,040
are both talented and useful
for our country.

413
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,600
With the Ye family helping us,

414
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,800
Jia Pass will be safe,

415
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,670
and the Sheng will be safe!

416
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,560
What's more,

417
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,840
I've heard
Tantai Minglang is cruel and sinister.

418
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,390
Even if we can't get Tantai Jin back,

419
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,760
he has to fight with his brother
after he returns.

420
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
For the Sheng,

421
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,350
it's not a bad thing.

422
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,630
That's what you wanted to tell me today,

423
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,110
am I right?

424
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,710
What?

425
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,280
You've learned to say things

426
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,840
you don't mean before me now.

427
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,280
I'm terrified.

428
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,320
Alright.

429
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,000
The Ye family is useful to us.

430
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,840
A stumble may prevent a fall.

431
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,080
I'll give this favor

432
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,800
to the Ye family for you.

433
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,190
Check the repositories while you're there.

434
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,430
I will reward you.

435
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,000
Leave us.

436
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,630
Yes.

437
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,110
Tantai Jin has been a hostage
in Sheng for many years.

438
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,280
His mother is of a different race.

439
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,320
So, he has no foundation
in the court at all.

440
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,870
He's nothing.

441
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
May I make bold to ask

442
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,910
why you always take him as an eyesore?

443
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,350
Because someone has been

444
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,000
thinking about him all the time.

445
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,480
[Memorial Tablet of Holy
Emperor of the Great Jing]

446
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,950
[You are the eldest lineal son]

447
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,390
and my most capable son.

448
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,910
The Jing is in your hands now.

449
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,670
Father, you entrust me with this.

450
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,150
I'm really grateful.

451
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,670
Now,

452
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,240
I only have one unfulfilled wish left.

453
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,080
Minglang.

454
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,320
Would you please fulfill my wish?

455
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,560
Of course, I will.

456
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,280
Your wish is the will of God.

457
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,710
Please tell me.

458
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,670
[I want to bring Tantai Jin back
to the Jing as soon as possible.]

459
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,190
[In this world…]

460
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,520
[only his eyes look like Concubine Rou's.]

461
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
[I really want to see these eyes again.]

462
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,910
Then I can rest in peace.

463
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,910
Is Concubine Rou the only regret

464
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,320
you have in your life?

465
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,950
Have you forgotten why my mother died?

466
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,910
[It was the first year after the witch
who could talk to animals]

467
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,240
[entered the palace.]

468
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
[During the autumn hunt,]

469
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,430
you were attacked by a beast.

470
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,670
My mother died

471
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,000
to save your life.

472
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,390
Everyone said it was the witch

473
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,000
who manipulated the beast
to kill my mother.

474
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,480
But you are so partial and protective!

475
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,390
Don't bring up the old story again!

476
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,000
It was only an accident.

477
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,480
[There's a sharp question I've always]

478
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,350
[wanted to ask you.]

479
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
If Concubine Rou
hadn't had a difficult delivery

480
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,110
and Tantai Jin had been born safely,

481
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,150
would you still entrust me

482
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,350
with the kingdom today?

483
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,150
The Jing kingdom

484
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,430
will soon be mine.

485
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,870
A man dies the way a lamp goes out.

486
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,320
This is just your guess.

487
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,670
That's right.

488
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,240
A man dies

489
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,350
the way a lamp goes out.

490
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,870
Tantai Jin.

491
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,670
Your Highness.

492
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,840
Why is the boat slowing down?

493
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,910
I think we are approaching
the confluence with the Mohe River.

494
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,430
The Mohe River is muddy and turbulent.

495
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,560
Every year, it breaks the dike.
It's an unlucky river.

496
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,280
That's why the boat slows down

497
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,430
when passing it through.

498
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,000
Oh.

499
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,280
I'm coming to tell Your Highness

500
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,800
Qi Shuang has sent a message back.

501
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,630
They have been searching the shore
all night.

502
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,350
Finally, they found Miss Xiwu.

503
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,040
I didn't dare to delay.

504
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,670
So I asked them to wait for us
at the ferry in the front.

505
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,600
How is she?

506
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,110
Her life is not in danger.

507
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,840
She choked on a lot of water.

508
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,430
I've said it. She wouldn't get away.

509
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,390
Well done.

510
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,150
Let her take a rest.

511
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,870
Take off the hood.

512
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,670
Yes.

513
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,670
Your Highness!

514
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,520
Protect His Highness.

515
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,040
Your Highness.

516
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,630
Your Highness!

517
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,910
Are you okay, Your Highness?

518
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,630
Your Highness!

519
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,000
You took a poisonous demonic elixir,

520
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,630
and were blinded by a poisoned needle.

521
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,710
How do you feel now?

522
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,880
Qi Shuang!

523
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,560
Why are you rebelling against our tribe?

524
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,270
Your Highness, let's retreat now.

525
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,670
[D*mn.]

526
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,080
Nian Baiyu.

527
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,710
There are more enemies besides these guys.

528
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,440
We don't have much time. Take the board.

529
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,000
Yes.

530
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,360
Stop!

531
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,520
High Priestess.

532
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,670
Tell them to surrender.

533
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,480
Or I will kill Tantai Jin right now!

534
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,520
Everyone, put down your weapons!

535
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,190
Excellent! Excellent indeed!

536
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,400
The High Priestess of the Yiyue tribe.

537
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,400
You're very resourceful.

538
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,110
Somehow, you found a way

539
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,480
to trick this idiot into docking.

540
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,620
It was a bloodless victory.

541
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,310
You've made a great achievement!

542
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,150
Your Highness, you're wise.

543
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,230
Your daughter has been set up for life.

544
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,230
Her illness is almost cured.

545
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,750
You've done such a wonderful job.

546
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,750
I'll send Fuya back to you when we return.

547
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

548
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,630
My third brother.

549
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,920
We meet again after so many years.

550
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
You do have the same eyes

551
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,790
as that witch.

552
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,110
What a pity.

553
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,710
One is blinded.

554
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,440
Do you know?

555
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,480
When our old father died,

556
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,670
he said he wanted to see these eyes again.

557
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,480
How about I grant him his wish today?

558
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,710
I'll dig out your eyes

559
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,600
and put them
in front of his memorial tablet.

560
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,750
What do you think?

561
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,310
You haven't changed since you were young.

562
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,110
You don't like to talk,
but you like to bark like a dog.

563
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,480
Say!

564
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,310
Say something!

565
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,960
Tantai Minglang.

566
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,600
Why are you wasting time
recalling past events?

567
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,400
I trusted the wrong person
and fell for your trap.

568
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,880
I admit my loss.

569
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,230
Oh, my third brother.

570
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,790
I'm not cruel by nature.

571
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Even if you want to die soon,

572
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,230
it depends on me

573
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,440
to give you this grace.

574
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,830
Someone!

575
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,150
Bring the gift.

576
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Do you know how I got these scars

577
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,230
on my body?

578
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,520
The question sounds meaningless.

579
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,670
Apparently, it doesn't.

580
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,230
It's all thanks to you!

581
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,150
Me?

582
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,080
When I was six,

583
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,440
Concubine Rou called wild beasts

584
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,880
to kill my mother during the autumn hunt.

585
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,790
[Even though everyone knew no one else ]

586
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,360
[Memorial Tablet of Holy Empress of the Jing]
[but Concubine Rou did it.]

587
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,600
[But Father was partial to her]

588
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,630
[and defended her.]

589
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,440
[He totally disregarded]

590
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,520
[my mother's devotion and sacrifice.]
Shut up!

591
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,560
[Stop discussing this matter further.]

592
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,150
[I have my own decision.]

593
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,440
[My mother just passed away.]

594
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,040
[But Concubine Rou was pregnant.]

595
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,360
[Everyone in the palace said]

596
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,440
[if she gave birth to a prince,]

597
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,710
[she would definitely be the new queen.]

598
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,920
[Her son]

599
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,750
[would become
the future emperor of the Jing.]

600
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,270
If Concubine Rou gave birth to a prince…

601
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,670
[The servants who served me]

602
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,230
[became more and more slack
because of this.]

603
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,710
[One day in winter,]

604
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,750
[a pot with no cover appeared]

605
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,440
[in my chamber.]

606
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,600
What happened?

607
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,110
Something's wrong.

608
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,880
[I fell into the charcoal fire.]

609
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,000
[My life was at stake.]
His Hignness…

610
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,670
[My father, however, is coaxing
Concubine Rou to take a nap.]

611
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,080
[And he came very late.]

612
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,750
[I didn't know
how long I had been waiting.]

613
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,230
[He finally came.]

614
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,230
[But he didn't even check on me.]

615
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,440
[I only heard him say one sentence
outside the room.]

616
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,480
Minglang has hurt his face
and looks ominous now.

617
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm afraid it will be difficult for him
to inherit the throne.

618
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,440
This is your and Concubine Rou's fault.

619
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,750
You must pay for it!

620
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,150
Try the coals' heat!

621
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,080
Your Highness!

622
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,150
I promised to help you kill Tantai Jin.

623
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,400
But I didn't promise you

624
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,080
I'd watch you torture him.

625
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,960
Shut up!

626
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,150
See where you stand!

627
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,440
I know your story now.

628
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,560
But your pain has nothing to do with me.

629
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,190
If you want revenge,

630
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,920
you should go to Tantai Wuji!

631
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,270
I don't owe you anything.

632
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,310
You do!

633
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,750
It's all your fault!

634
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,270
I'll make you suffer
a thousand times more!

635
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,270
I will torture you
until no one can recognize you.

636
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,830
I want you to get down on your knees
and beg me to kill you!

637
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,630
Today,

638
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,400
I can't escape.

639
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,480
But there is one thing

640
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,630
I want to know.

641
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:23,710
Fine.

642
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,150
I will give you a chance

643
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,830
and let you die after you get the answers.

644
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,790
Auntie.

645
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,960
Why did you betray me?

646
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,920
I shouldn't have betrayed you.

647
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,600
It's my fault.

648
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,480
But…

649
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,310
I have Fuya now.

650
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,520
She is my daughter.

651
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,150
It's just for your daughter.

652
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,880
You were not such a weak person.

653
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:47,920
Right.

654
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,400
I was not like this before.

655
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,190
But once I love someone,

656
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,040
I have a bond.

657
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,400
I'm no longer indestructible.

658
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,600
A few years ago, Fuya got lost.

659
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,710
Prince Minglang helped me find her.

660
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,440
I want to be loyal to you,

661
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,110
but I can't lose my daughter.

662
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,110
Before,

663
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,190
I had no children.

664
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,270
I treated you as if you were my son.

665
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,270
But these years, God took pity on me

666
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,920
and let me have a daughter.

667
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,480
You are gloomy and hard to understand.

668
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,560
But my daughter is pure and beautiful.

669
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,480
If I had to choose one person to save,

670
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,360
it's not you. I think
everyone would make the same choice.

671
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,040
Is that so?

672
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,040
What about the relationship between us?

673
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,960
Can you bear to…

674
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,560
Your Highness!

675
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,480
I already know the reason

676
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,880
why Yingxin went crazy.

677
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,560
I don't believe

678
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,630
you did it because of this traitor.

679
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,400
That's just another reason.

680
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,040
It made me understand

681
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,400
you are a cold fish,

682
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,360
heartless and ungrateful.

683
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,190
She tried to kill me.

684
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,560
Yingxin and I brought you up.

685
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,520
But for you,

686
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,400
our betrayal

687
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,630
is no different than anyone else's!

688
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,520
We're not special.

689
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,310
That's the worst part.

690
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,190
You take advantage of people

691
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,830
who are good to you without burden.

692
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,360
For those who treat you badly,

693
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,750
you can just kill them with no mercy.

694
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,110
How can you do that!

695
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,400
What's wrong with that?

696
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
But this is inhuman!

697
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,880
I didn't expect I could use Ye Xiwu

698
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,880
to set you up this time.

699
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,630
It was you who let Ye Xiwu go.

700
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,750
It was you
who untied the Ruo-River rope for her.

701
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,150
And then, you lied that you found her

702
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,630
to make the ship dock.

703
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,710
If you didn't go that way,

704
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,520
and if they boarded the boat by force,

705
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,360
there would be more casualties.

706
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,190
You see?

707
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,830
Once you fall for someone,

708
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,600
you're not indestructible anymore.

709
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,040
You are wrong.

710
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,880
For me, Ye Xiwu

711
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,150
isn't special at all.

712
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,480
Finally,

713
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,880
you have feelings for someone.

714
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,110
But I used her

715
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,040
to kill you.

716
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,630
How ironic it is!

717
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,400
Auntie, let me ask you.

718
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,270
Do you regret betraying me?

719
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,750
My child,

720
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,710
I don't regret it.

721
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,750
Back then, in the cold palace of the Jing,

722
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,960
I saved your life
with the blood from my fingertips.

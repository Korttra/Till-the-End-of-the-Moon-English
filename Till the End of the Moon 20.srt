Why? You don't like it?

172
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,210
No, I'm just a bit surprised.

173
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,810
Ye Xiwu.

174
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,210
I'll give you one-day leave.

175
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,930
Go home.

176
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,240
Great.

177
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,360
Tantai Jin.

178
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,610
Come with me.

179
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,330
Let's celebrate it together.

180
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,240
Sure.

181
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,360
Grandma, I'm full.

182
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,690
Have more. The noodles stand for a long life.

183
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,610
Look at you.

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,450
You've lost a lot of weight in the palace.

185
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,160
Chuntao told me

186
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,400
that Tantai Jin stays outside the door.

187
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,880
As far as I can see,

188
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,090
he has every reason

189
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,000
to refuse to enter our house.

190
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,330
As I recall,

191
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,640
when he was here,

192
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,880
he had a pretty tough time.

193
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,850
Even if Zeyu

194
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,480
didn't find fault with him,

195
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,240
me and your father

196
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,240
have never really looked at him with respect.

197
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,000
We mistreated him.

198
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,450
[No wonder he happily came with me,]

199
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,400
[but then refused to come in at the door.]

200
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,760
[It seems that he is reminded
of something unhappy from the past.]

201
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,050
To be honest,

202
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,120
he spares our lives

203
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,480
despite our ill-treatment,

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,480
so I'm grateful for that

205
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,240
even though he's an enemy of the Sheng.

206
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,610
Besides, I can tell

207
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,570
he really cares about you.

208
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,000
Xiwu, you should cherish it.

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,210
As for other aspects,

210
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,690
we can save them for later consideration.

211
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,280
There's no need to rush.

212
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,050
You're right, Father.

213
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm full. I should go back now.

214
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,360
I have some unfinished business in the palace.

215
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,450
Xiwu.

216
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,280
Xiwu.

217
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,090
[Ye Mansion]

218
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,970
Tantai Jin.

219
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:42,930
What happened?

220
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,210
Why do you return so early?

221
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,880
You had a tough time here.

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,640
It's so foolish of me to take you back.

223
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,280
I only thought you'd feel lonely in the palace.

224
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,120
The trip is meant to cheer you up.

225
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,810
Yet, you end up waiting for me here.

226
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,520
I…

227
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,930
It's okay.

228
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,450
Did you enjoy your birthday?

229
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,570
That's enough.

230
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,970
Although I didn't visit your family,

231
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,120
still,

232
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,330
I'm happy you take me with you.

233
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,880
Since we have come,

234
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,330
let me show you a place.

235
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,520
[Lingxing Hall]

236
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,970
[Lingxing Hall]
You mentioned your old home.

237
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,930
This is the place
I desired most when I was young.

238
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,120
[Auntie Lan'an.]

239
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,970
[Do you know where Lingxing Hall is?]

240
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,000
[Is it far from here?]

241
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,570
Lingxing Hall?

242
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,400
They said Concubine Rou is buried there.

243
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,880
She's my mom.

244
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,360
I want to take a look.

245
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,730
Can we reach there in one or two days?

246
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,730
Well, Lingxing Hall

247
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,090
is right beside the city gate.

248
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
It's quite close.

249
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,440
Only an hour's walk.

250
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,610
However, it's an imperial graveyard.

251
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,640
It's not for you to come.

252
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,920
Understand?

253
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,250
This one hour's walk

254
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,290
is so long that I didn't finish

255
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,640
until I took the throne.

256
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,170
[Sun Huiran, Concubine Yun, Yue Ruanruan, Concubine Rou
Meng Jingshu, Concubine Lan]

257
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:01,170
[Sun Huiran, Concubine Yun, Yue Ruanruan, Concubine Rou
Meng Jingshu, Concubine Lan]

258
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:10,210
[Sun Huiran, Concubine Yun, Yue Ruanruan, Concubine Rou
Meng Jingshu, Concubine Lan]

259
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,010
Mother.

260
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,250
She's Ye Xiwu.

261
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,960
I'm his wife.

262
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,680
If you saw her for yourself,

263
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,440
you'd love her.

264
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,850
Tantai Jin is now the Emperor of the Jing.

265
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,010
He's doing pretty well. You can rest assured.

266
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,720
I'll come and see you when I have time.

267
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,290
This is my line.

268
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,920
Come.

269
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,360
I give you this opportunity

270
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,290
to pick a place you like

271
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,680
and decide where you want to be buried.

272
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,570
Stop patronizing me.

273
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,440
I never said
I'd spend the rest of my life with you.

274
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,880
Answer me, Ye Xiwu.

275
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,640
Do you have feelings for me?

276
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,090
One day together, deep love forever.

277
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,530
Of course, you're my husband.

278
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,440
No, I don't mean the marital duty.

279
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,770
I want your true love.

280
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,120
[Little Devil God.]

281
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,850
[This is the only thing I can't give.]

282
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,720
It's fine. I understand.

283
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,200
True love doesn't come easily.

284
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,050
There's no need to rush.

285
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,090
I heard your mother also passed
when you were young.

286
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,850
If you want to commemorate her,

287
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,440
I can set up a spirit tablet here for her.

288
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,360
Don't bother.

289
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,010
She passed away a very long time ago.

290
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,680
Are you sure?

291
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,250
You used to cry

292
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,610
every time you went to pay respects before.

293
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,880
Remember?

294
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,330
A bit late to restore decency, don't you think?

295
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,090
[Sorry, I'm not Ye Xiwu.]

[Why does he want my affection?]

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,200
[Is he ]

299
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,720
[in love with me?]

300
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,160
[The spikes accumulate so slowly.]

301
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,290
[I suppose he doesn't understand love yet.]

302
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,920
[Until when]

303
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,960
[will I collect all of them?]

304

[Ji Ze said after his fall,]

305

[Barren Abyss Barrier lasts only 300 days.]

[while nine will pierce his heart.]

309
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,440
Your Majesty.

310
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,570
This is the information we intercept.

311
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,250
How dare Lin harbor such a thought

312
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,530
when I give him the control.

313
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,770
Calm down, Your Majesty.

314
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,850
How can I calm down?

315
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,200
Haven't you heard the rumor in the city?

316
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,440
They said

317
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,530
Prince Xuancheng disapproved of my decision

318
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,400
to start a war.

319
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,960
He thinks I abuse force

320
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,090
at the cost of people.

321
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,010
A rumor is a rumor.

322
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,330
I've urged him many times.

323
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,530
Have you ever seen him deploy his troops?

324
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,360
I suppose everyone in the court

325
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,680
is expecting me

326
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,440
to hand him the throne.

327
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,360
Your Majesty.

328
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,490
Prince Xuancheng is loyal to you.

329
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,490
There must be a reason
why he doesn't deploy troops.

330
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Maybe you think too much.

331
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,850
I didn't mean it.

332
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,250
I suppose you're one of them.

333
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,770
Guards,

334
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,360
drag him out

335
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,440
and club him to death.

336
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,360
-Yes.
-Yes.

337
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,770
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

338
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,440
Your Majesty.

339
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,490
Please spare me.

340
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Your Majesty.

341
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,720
Report.

342
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,440
Your Highness. An order from the capital.

343
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,770
What is it, Your Highness?

344
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,360
His Majesty demands us
to march north in three days.

345
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,290
What should we do?

346
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,250
If we do this,

347
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,880
the casualties will be grave.

348
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,010
What do you think, Your Highness?

349
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,050
Follow the order, of course.

350
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:12,960
Your Highness.

351
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,960
There's something I must say.

352
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
A general does what needs to be done.

353
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,530
As you said earlier,

354
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,920
as long as we stay put,

355
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,250
we can hold the Mohe River.

356
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,050
If we attack recklessly,

357
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,160
we're almost sure to fall.

358
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,200
I'm a subject of the Sheng

359
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,050
and the son of Emperor Sheng.

360
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
I can't disobey my father's order.

361
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,920
I shall lead the soldiers

362
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,360
and make a final attempt.

363
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,250
This battle is going to be tough.

364
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,120
Yes.

365
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
What should we do?

366
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,250
Your Majesty, Xiao Lin has passed the river

367
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,610
and landed on the north bank.

368
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,330
As I expected, Emperor Sheng takes the bait.

369
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,680
Qingyu, I promised you

370
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,960
to unite the country and end the war.

371
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,920
The time has come.

372
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,090
Qingyu.

373
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,250
Follow me. Let's ride to Jia Pass.

374
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:29,850
Yes.

375
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,960
Where is Tantai Jin?

376
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,440
He left for the battlefield.

377
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,490
Not long ago.

378
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,680
They said Xiao Lin
swooped on the Mohe River last night.

379
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,090
Xiao Lin.

380
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,960
Why didn't he take you?

381
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,120
What an innocent girl.

382
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,850
With so many great generals in the Jing,

383
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,610
including your own brother in the front,

384
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,250
why would he ever think of me?

385
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,850
Your Highness.

386
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,290
The enemy at Jia Pass

387
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,920
didn't expect us to cross the river so quickly.

388
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,160
We can break
through this pass in less than half a day.

389
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,610
It would cost too many lives.

390
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,440
If we can't take Jia Pass today,

391
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,920
we'll lose nearly half of our men.

392
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,770
We'll succeed.

393
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,570
There are only
a few thousand troops here in Jia Pass.

394
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,680
We almost broke
right through here following them.

395
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,360
They won't last long.

396
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,960
Never underestimate your enemy.

397
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,160
We lost our men to cross the Mohe River.

398
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,530
We fought so hard for days
before seeing a glimmer of hope.

399
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,810
If we can't take Jia Pass by force today,

400
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,330
then we crossed the river in vain.

401
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,680
Everyone.

402
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,290
Return to the city at once.

403
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,010
[Jia Pass]

404
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,200
Tantai Jin is already here.

405
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,010
He came faster than I thought.

406
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,250
Your Majesty.

407
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,360
Shall we send the Moonshadow Guards
to flank them from the outside?

408
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,810
We could eliminate them once and for all.

409
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,850
There's no need.

410
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,610
Today, I'll hold Xiao Lin captive
by myself on the battlefield

411
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,640
and destroy the Sheng's will to fight.

412
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,490
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

413
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,090
Your Highness.

414
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,290
Your Highness.

415
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,570
He's the Emperor of the Jing.

416
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,810
He can do witchcraft.

417
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,720
I heard that he could drive demon beasts.

418
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,570
It was his Firewing Army

419
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,530
that breached General Ye's defenses

420
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,770
and defeated him in less than half a month.

421
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,610
He was a hostage prince in the Sheng.

422
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
His Majesty didn't treat him well.

423
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,010
He's not going to get back at us, is he?

424
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Xiao Lin, we could talk.

425
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:03,920
Don't go there.

426
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,720
It's okay.

427
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,810
Xiao Lin.

428
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,010
Now you have all the prestige of the Sheng.

429
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,120
If you would submit to me,

430
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,770
I don't mind sharing the world with you.

431
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,920
Likewise.

432
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,640
If you're willing to withdraw your troops

433
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,770
and submit yourself to the Sheng,

434
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm also willing to tell my father

435
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,330
and make you a lord.

436
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,960
You really don't care about the lives

437
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,610
of the Sheng's soldiers, Your Highness.

438
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,720
Your army has suffered heavy losses
at the Mohe River and Jia Pass.

439
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,400
You knew that your odds
of winning this battle were slim,

440
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,770
but you couldn't go
against your emperor's orders,

441
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,610
so you decided to take the plunge.

442
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,810
Am I right?

443
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,490
What a pity.

444
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,850
Had I been here a few hours later,

445
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,530
perhaps you really could have taken Jia Pass.

446
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,570
However, as smart as you should know,

447
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,570
even if you managed to retreat today,

448
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,770
the Sheng

449
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,490
will only last for a few more days.

450
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,880
The Sheng has not come to an end yet.

451
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,090
Don't you try to mislead people here.

452
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,090
Xiao Lin.

453
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,400
A great man should go with the flow,

454
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,880
not fight it pointlessly.

455
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,160
Looks like

456
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,810
there's no deal.

457
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,010
Xiao Lin, you knew perfectly well

458
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,640
that you couldn't win.

459
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,290
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

460
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,400
Heart-guarding Scale.

461
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
What a treasure.

462
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,010
Jia Pass is such an ideal place
to draw lightning.

463
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,490
Look how much thunderbolt and lightning

464
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,760
just one Lightning Charm can draw.

465
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,490
It's a pity that you reacted too fast,
Your Majesty.

466
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,800
Otherwise, you could personally taste

467
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,450
what it's like to be struck by lightning.

468
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,240
We missed our timing. There's no need to fight.

469
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,050
Let's call it quits and retreat.

470
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,890
Your Majesty.

471
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,760
Let them go.

472
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,370
Why, Your Majesty?

473
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,800
He's a smart man.

474
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,050
This war

475
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,840
was first started by Emperor Sheng.

476
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,280
It's a war with no just cause.

477
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,800
The forced attack on Jia Pass

478
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,320
was just his last attempt.

479
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,410
He knew he couldn't win.

480
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,090
[Only when I reunite all the lands]

481
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,280
[will the war truly end]

482
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,320
Useless!

483
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,970
You are all useless.

484
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,680
Tantai Jin is almost here.

485
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,120
Go back and tell Xiao Lin

486
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,410
that if he can't hold Boshan City,

487
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,610
he doesn't have to come back.

488
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,890
Also, send an edict
to Side Concubine of Xuancheng.

489
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,090
Tell her to come to the palace at once

490
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,490
and stay at the Empress's side.

491
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,640
Your Highness.

492
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,680
Why did you get hurt so badly this time?

493
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,450
Tantai Jin was on the battlefield himself.

494
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,680
Tantai Jin?

495
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,840
His troops will soon reach here.

496
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,240
If we lost Boshan City,

497
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,640
the Sheng will have
no more strongholds to defend.

498
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,410
However, judging from our current situation,

499
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,680
there's nothing we can do.

500
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,200
Your Highness.

501
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,320
A country's fate is unpredictable.

502
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,490
The current situation

503
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
is not something you can control alone.

504
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,970
Bingchang, I'm a son of the Xiao family.

505

My father may be unkind,

506

507
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,930

508

If I die on the battlefield one day…

509
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,010
Your Highness,
please don't say something like that.

510
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,640
Death is always a hair's breadth
away on the battlefield.

511
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,090
I should have told you this earlier.

512

Bingchang.

513
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,320
If I die in the future,

514
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,800
I hope you won't have to remain a widow for me.

515

and can take care of you
for the rest of your life,

518
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,280
it's not a bad idea to marry again.

519
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,530
No.

520
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,410

521

525

I shouldn't have scared you.

526

It's okay. Don't cry now.

[And what will happen to Father?]

681
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,930
Since Side Concubine of Xuancheng
came into the palace,

682
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,720
she has been following the Empress
day after day to pray to Buddha

683
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,280
and copying sutras in small script.

684
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,530
She also eats vegetarian food with her.

685
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,720
There isn't any meat in her meal.
What a poor woman.

686
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,490
Why should a servant take pity on his master?

687
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,930
The entire Ye family
betrayed our country so shamelessly.

688
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,410
It's merciful to keep her alive.

689
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,160
She's here.

690
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,050
Are you all right, my lady?

691
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,890
I'm fine.

692
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,200
After we get back,

693
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,800
I'll use hot towels to warm your knees.

694
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,280
There's no need for that.

695
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,680
Our place is still leaking.

696
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,970
I'll go ask them to fix it for us.

697
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,680
Don't bother. No matter how many times we asked,
it didn't work.

698
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,840
In the future,

699
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:27,970
we'll repair the leaking roofs

700
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,490
and torn clothes by ourselves.

701
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,010
As I said before,

702
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,680
power is a powerful tool.

703
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,160
However, I'm just a weak woman.

704
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,530
I can only rely on powerful men.

705
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,410
I thought Xiao Lin was my lifelong support,

706
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,280
but now he won't even answer my letters.

707
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:50,800
Thank you

708
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,010
for watching out for me
in the palace these days.

709
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,010
I don't understand.

710
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,760
You keep saying
things like this lately, my lady.

711
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,840
I'm a little scared.

712
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:05,890
It's okay.

713
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,530
I'm here with you.

714

Let's go.

715
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:15,930
Be careful.

Your Majesty.

717
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,760
No letter today either.

718
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,640
It has been half a month.

719
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,120
Have you asked the crow why?

720
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,370
You can also speak with birds and animals.

721
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,320
Why don't you ask him yourself, Your Majesty?

722
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,720
This is your family business after all.

723
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,640
Nian Baiyu, you brat. I'll beat you to death.

724
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,200
I don't care if she writes to me or not.

725
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:19,640
Your Majesty.

726
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,840
All of you must be exhausted today.

727
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,970
Get some rest.

728
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,890
-Yes.
-Yes.

729
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,010
I didn't expect you to keep up with us.

730
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,760

731
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,760
You knew I was here all along,

732
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,090
and you watched me suffer every day.

733
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,610
I haven't written to him for many days.

734
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,760
I wonder if he has forgotten about me.

735
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,970
[Luckily, that spike didn't shrink back.]

736

Rest assured. You're playing hard to get now.

737
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,050
As you know,

738
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,370
if you cling to men all day,

739
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:26,680
they won't take you seriously.

740
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,090
Being cold toward them occasionally
can be very effective.

741
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,410
Trust me.

742
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,640
His Majesty lives there.

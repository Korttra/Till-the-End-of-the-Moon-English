Your Highness, please take
this bottle of Ruo Water.

20
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,320
OK.

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,830
What's special about this Ruo Water?

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,320
Your Highness,
I was worried about your safety.

23
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,800
To be prepared for
any unexpected situations,

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,270
I have specially prepared
this bottle of Ruo Water for you.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,750
It can greatly enhance
the power of the Puppet Soldiers,

which may save your life.

Hurry up!

Dad.

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,750
Dad,

53
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,520
what are you doing?

54
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,000
Doing what I should do.

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,520
But, Dad,

56
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,750
this is Jing's capital,

57
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,720
and what does this kingdom
have to do with us?

58
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,390
Zeyu,

59
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,800
I am already in my declining years,

60
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,190
and my remaining time is limited.

61
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,630
I was powerless when our Sheng

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,110
suffered defeat and decline,

63
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,350
and that made me disloyal.

64
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,550
I will never forgive myself
even till my death.

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,070
Now that the kingdoms are unified,

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,160
the people of every kingdom

67
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,600
are all citizens of the same country.

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,390
As someone who practices martial arts,

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,550
if I turn a blind eye to

70
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,670
the rebels slaughtering innocent people,

71
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,790
it would be unjust.

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,640
I, Ye Xiao, am not
a disloyal and unjust person.

73

Don't lose it.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,480
We may not be able
to take care of you in the future.

90
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,550
You should take care.

to control the people.

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,230
When two people are wearing
the Yin-Yang Bracelets,

173
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,280
as long as the one wearing
the Yang Bracelet doesn't die,

174
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,000
the owner of the Yin Bracelet won't die.

175
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,790
In terms of the reason,

176
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
the one wearing the Yang Bracelet
is using his lifespan

177
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,910
to resist the fatal disaster
for the owner of the Yin Bracelet.

178
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,470
Ye Xiwu,

179
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,880
even if you loathe me,

180
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,320
I would do anything

181
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,790
to keep you alive.

182
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,910
Choose!

183
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,670
Or I'll kill both of them!

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Help me!

185
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,790
Choose!

186
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,280
Let go of

187
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,470
Ye Bingchang.

188
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,790
That's good.

189
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,110
This way, I don't owe you anything anymore.

190
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,670
Ye Xiwu,

191
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,110
don't you even care?

192
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,640
Looks like you mean very little to him.

193
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,960
Let me free you then.

194
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,180
[Yingtian Gate]

195
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,080
You will never be able to repay it.

196
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,320
No, no way…

197
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,230
Ye Xiwu,

198
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,790
what are you doing?

199
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,200
Stop it!

200
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,920
Ye Xiwu,

201
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,680
don't you leave me!

202
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,680
I will not allow you to leave me again,

203
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,470
not like what Sang Jiu did.

204

Ye Xiwu,

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,760
why do you have it?

207
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,680
This World-overturning Jade

208
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,160

Ye Xiwu,

216
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,350
why did you do that?

217
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,280
Because you lost an eye,

218
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,680
and you looked really pitiful.

Because you are not an ordinary person.

You were born with an evil bone

and destined to become the new Devil God,

why should I gamble
the fate of all living beings

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,470
on the extremely faint hope
that there may still be

295
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,070
a trace of goodness
in the heart of the Devil God?

296

I cannot afford to take that risk.

Even if my soul shatters,

From beginning to end,

312
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,520
you were just a target of my mission.

313
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,590
I shot six soul-slaying spikes into you.

314
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,880
I did hurt you,

315
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,640
but I also bore

316

325
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,560

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,110
I don't want your essence.

330
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,590
I'll return it to you.

331
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,950
Stop it now!

332
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,880
I said I wouldn't let you leave me.

333
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,640
Even if I have to live in your hatred forever,

334
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,110
I'm willing to accept that!

335

509
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,910
[Is it because of that woman?]

510
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,120
[What a shame.]

511
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,230
Get away from me!

512
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,520
[She's dead.]

513
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,630
[Everyone around you will leave you.]

514
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,360
That's not true.

515
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,800
[You will only bring disasters
to those who stay.]

516
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,560
[They all hate you.]

517
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,600
[They'd rather die to get away from you.]

518
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,800
[Look how your hands]

519
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,280
[are stained with her blood.]

520
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,280
[From beginning to end you can only live alone.]

521
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,470
What a shame.

522
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,630
I will never

523
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,430
let you have your way.

524
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,630
Ye Xiwu won't leave me!

525
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,230
Why don't you show up now?

526
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,000
Prove it to him now!

527
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,800
Ye Xiwu!

528
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,560
Ye Xiwu!

529
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,870
Ye Xiwu!

530
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,230
Ye Xiwu!

531
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,000
Ye Xiwu!

532
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,760
Your Majesty!

533
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,910
Your Majesty!

534
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,710
Your Majesty, the doctor said you need to rest.

535
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,560
Just take a good rest, Your Majesty.

536
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,080
Where's Ye Xiwu?

537
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,560
I'm asking you where is Ye Xiwu!

538
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,800
I don't know.

539
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,840
Scram!

540
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,630
Your Majesty!

541
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,320
Ye Xiwu.

542
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,320
There you are.

543
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,000
I've been looking everywhere for you.

544
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:16,910
No.

545
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,000
Why are you here?

546
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,520
It's so cold in here.

547
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,600
Wake up.

548
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,600
Come back with me.

549
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,630
Ye Xiwu, wake up!

550
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,600
I'm talking to you.

551
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,080
Ye Xiwu!

552
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,840
[She's dead.]

553
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,390
Ye Xiwu, get up.

554
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,950
-[She abandoned you.]
-Just get up!

555
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,630

I'm talking to you.

557
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,560
I'm talking to you!

558
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,600
Why don't you answer?

559
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,230
Speak!

560
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,910
Speak!

561
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,040
Didn't you want to kill me?

562
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,910
Weren't you crueler than me?

563
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm right in front of you!

564
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,390
I'm right here!

565
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,840
Get up and keep killing me!

566
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,470
Keep hating me!

567
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,950
Just say one word, please.

568
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,280
Ye Xiwu.

569
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,360
Ye Xiwu.

570
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
You're really hateful.

571
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,120
[From beginning to end,]

572
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,600
[you can only live alone.]

573
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,190
[Your won't succeed.]

574
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,870
[If I can't save her,]

575
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,430
[I'll die with her!]

576
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,710
The post-war compensations have all been done.

577
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,040
The hardest times are finally over.

578
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,360
But I'm just wondering

579
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,320
when His Majesty will get himself together.

580
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,760
If this goes on, I'm afraid his body will…

581
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,080
Send more hands over there.

582
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:03,600
Including the hall.

583
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,840
Go ahead now.

584
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,320
General Ye,

585
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,320
you can walk now.

586
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,280
What about His Majesty?

587
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,630
His Majesty's been staying in the mourning hall.

588
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,800
General Ye,

589
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,360
you're Miss Xiwu's younger brother after all.

590
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,430
Please go talk to him.

591
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:26,840
You're his only family now.

592
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,230
I'll go meet him.

593
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,800
Hold on.

594
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,670
His Majesty sealed the door with demonic power.

595
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Regular people can't get in.

596
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,760
We gotta find out a way.

597
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,280
It's fine.

598
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,950
I can get in.

599
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,390
Let's go.

600
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,760
What's this?

601
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,600
He melted the original Ruo Water Ice Coffin,

602
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,320
so that he could be sealed with her forever.

603
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,910
Just like…

604
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,280
Just like amber.

605
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,000
General Ye,

606
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,910
one will die of coldness

607
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,950
if he's lying in there for too long.

608
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:23,760
We must get His Majesty out of it first.

609
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:39,520
Your Majesty!

610
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:41,430
Your Majesty!

611
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:05,470
Your Majesty!

612
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,280
How dare you do this?

613
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,000
Your Majesty.

614
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,390
Get out.

615
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,760
You're courting death.

616
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,360
And you're hindering my sister

617
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,950
from leaving the world decently.

618
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,560
Leaving?

619
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,230
She's my wife.

620
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,560
She's my queen!

621
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,840
She can only be with me!

622
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,840
What if I insist on taking her away?

623
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,360
Go ahead if you dare.

624
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,600
Why would she marry you?

625
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,470
Don't you know that?

626
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,390
She said she loved me!

627
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,670
Nian Baiyu, stay out of it!

628
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,390
My sister might have loved you,

629
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,950
but you?

630
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,870
You used her

631
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,470
to kill Xiao Lin with her own hands!

632
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,520
You tortured her

633
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,230
so much that she had to kill herself!

634
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,670
Now you're still trying to trap her,

635
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:26,870
and to stop her from leaving.

636
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,760
Tantai Jin, you hate her so, huh?

637
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,230
No. I don't hate her.

638
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,040
She's the only one who's good to me.

639
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,710
The only one who loved me.

640
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,840
Ye Qingyu, do you understand?

641
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:46,360
You!

642
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,190
Break it off!

643
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,190
Since that's the case,

644
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,710
just let my sister go.

645
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,630
No.

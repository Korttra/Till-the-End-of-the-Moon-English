174
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,440
Wake up, Tantai Jin!

175
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,630
Tantai Jin!

176
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,630
Karma comes so quickly.

177
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,870
You were alive and kicking
when you tried to capture me.

178
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,320
Only a few hours later,

179
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,670
you're in my hands half-dead.

180
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,720
What are you looking at?

181
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,840
If not for the sake
of my father and my family,

182
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,240
I just wanna slap you to death

183
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,080
and bury you right here.

184
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,120
You'd better move as little as possible.

185
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,750
When pressing water out of you,

186
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,480
I accidentally broke a few of your ribs.

187
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,960
How come it's you?

188
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,150
Why did you save me?

189
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
None of your business.

190
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,790
Tantai Jin, I'm telling you.

191
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,600
Now you're in my hands.

192
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,790
I can save you,

193
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,910
and I can also kill you.

194
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,790
If you let yourself die

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,600
without my permission,

196
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,960
I'll tear you to pieces

197
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
and throw you into the wilderness.

198
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,550
[As expected, I can't see.]

199
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,240
Alright, now it's my turn.

200
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,720
Whether you like it or not,

201
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,550
you must answer my questions honestly.

202
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,320
What questions?

203
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,840
We're just apart for a few hours.

204
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
What exactly happened on the ship?

205
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,910
Why have you washed ashore

206
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,910
and lost one eye?

207
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,080
Are you gonna answer or not?

208
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,510
I was ambushed by Tantai Minglang.

209
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,870
Tantai Minglang?

210
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,600
Your elder brother from Jing Kingdom?

211
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,200
Why would he do that?

212
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,790
You should ask him about it.

213
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,840
Fine, next question.

214
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,120
Only you escaped from there?

215
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,600
Where's Jing Lan'an?

216
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,240
Isn't she with you?

217
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,720
She's dead.

218
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,960
Tantai Minglang killed her?

219
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,750
I killed her.

220
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,240
Tantai Jin,

221
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,790
this punch

222
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,140
is for those who died because of you.

223
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,750
This is both for Jing Lan'an and me.

224
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,390
I tried to treat you sincerely,

225
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,510
save and protect you,

226
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,910
but now I really regret it.

227
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,750
Jing Lan'an saved your life.

228
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,750
She brought you up.

229
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,150
You drank her blood
and were taught by her.

230
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
But you killed her!

231
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,390
Auntie,

232
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,910
let me ask you.

233
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,150
Do you regret betraying me?

234
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,030
My child,

235
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,510
I don't regret it.

236
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,390
Yeah.

237
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,030
You've gone insane.

238
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,670
You're right.

239
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,750
She brought me up.

240
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,240
She gave me life.

241
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,600
On that new year's Eve,
when she came for me,

242
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
I really wished

243
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,750
she didn't abandon me.

244
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,150
What?

245
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,390
Of all the things she did,

246
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,150
she shouldn't have returned after leaving.

247
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,630
She gave me hope

248
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,080
but then discarded me like trash.

249
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,000
What did Jing Lan'an do?

250
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,670
Nothing.

251
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,240
It's just betrayal.

252
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,360
She and Yingxin did the same.

253
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,030
She betrayed me.

254
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,840
[Turns out she let me go]

255
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,320
[in order to kill Tantai Jin.]

256
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,510
[Did she collude with Tantai Minglang?]

257
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,240
Tantai Jin,

258
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,240
I'm gonna escort you
back to Sheng Kingdom.

259
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,000
And then put you in prison

260
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,200
to keep you from the outside world.

261
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,350
I'll be watching you
every second of every day.

262
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,510
As long as I'm alive,

263
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,880
don't ever think
of devouring demonic elixirs

264
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,920
and killing.

265
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,920
What are you laughing at?

266
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,880
Ye Xiwu,

267
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,960
your stupid words
were both strange and funny.

268
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,070
Why don't you just kill me?

269
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,920
Why do you try
to be bound with me forever?

270
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,200
Your life and death

271
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,240
are not up to you now.

272
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,200
What are you doing?

273
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,030
Roasting fish.

274
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,070
Found it!

275
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,200
Here's blood!

276
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,640
Tantai Jin really survived.

277
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,590
He's such a pain in my neck,

278
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,000
just like that witch.

279
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,310
Your Highness,

280
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,070
although Tantai Jin isn't dead,

281
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,310
he's already a spent force.

282
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,960
Please let me tie up this loose end.

283
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,830
Your Highness may return to the capital
and wait for my good news.

284
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,110
No.

285
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,300
I must see Tantai Jin dead
with my own eyes.

286
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,000
Search farther away.

287
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,680
Even if we have to dig three feet deep,

288
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,150
we must find Tantai Jin!

289
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,280
Your Highness,

290
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,350
we'll be entering
the Jing territory ahead.

291
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,720
Still no news about Tantai Jin?

292
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,480
Your Highness,

293
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,000
we have a visual on Jing soldiers.

294
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,830
Are you sure?

295
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,040
From both their clothes and weapons,

296
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,520
they're absolutely from Jing Kingdom.

297
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,550
But we're not sure

298
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,480
why they are here in large numbers.

299
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,790
Lead the way.

300
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,040
Yes.

301
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,480
I didn't expect you
to be helping a little.

302
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,040
You have so many schemes,

303
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,550
but you're a good cook.

304
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,550
I've been doing this since little.

305
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,240
Didn't you grow up in the palace?

306
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,150
You roasted fish in the palace?

307
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,150
Red fish from the Taiye Pond.

308
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,350
Sparrows from the imperial woods.

309
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,680
Rats from the imperial gutters.

310
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,440
All these can be my food.

311
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,240
You just need a few grains of rice.

312
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,150
They'll bite the hook

313
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,830
and get themselves killed.

314
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,520
[This is Tantai Jin.]

315
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,590
[Both pitiable and detestable.]

316
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,680
[Fate has been cruel to him.]

317
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,150
[He also fought back with cruelty.]

318
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,440
[Li Susu, you gotta see clearly.]

319
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,480
[This is the Devil God.]

320
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,040
Eat.

321
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,310
You eat it.
When you finish, we'll hit the road.

322
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,830
We don't have time for you to heal.

323
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,040
It's not poisonous.

324
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,550
I know that.

325
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,280
Otherwise, why would I let you eat it?

326
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,830
Ye Xiwu,

327
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,280
I wonder why you don't wish me to die?

328
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,870
Don't worry.

329
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,480
One day I will tell you.

330
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,830
You'd better pray that day comes later.

331
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,870
[When I destroy the evil bone]

332
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
[and kill you,]

333
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,240
[I will tell you.]

334
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,310
What's wrong?

335
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
[Without the antidote,]

336
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,790
[I'm probably gonna be dead soon]

337
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,200
[when the poison kicks in.]

338
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,150
Nothing.

339
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,590
Tantai Jin.

340
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,280
We got company.

341
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,790
Hurry!

342
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,920
They haven't gone far. Split up and chase!

343
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,680
Yes!

344
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,310
They can't run far.

345
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,440
Search carefully!

346
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,720
Anyone who captures Tantai Jin
will be rewarded!

347
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,830
Yes!

348
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,830
It's Tantai Minglang's men.

349
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,760
Just hand me over to them.

350
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,150
You can both live and get rewards.

351
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,200
Shut up.

352
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,310
Go in the opposite direction.
Don't get caught.

353
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,070
Ye Xiwu.

354
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,310
Over there! After them!

355
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,960
After them!

356
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,750
Come on!

357
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,150
[Tantai Jin,
I really owe you in my last life.]

358
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,960
[I'm surrounded.]

359
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,870
[No.]

360
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,100
[I haven't found the way
to destroy the evil bone yet.]

361
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
[I can't die here.]

362
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,070
Split up.

363
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,630
Yes.

364
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
D*mn.

365
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
How come it's a woman?

366
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,680
You must have seen Tantai Jin.

367
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,390
Where is he? Say it!

368
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,390
Oh, that dead guy is called Tantai Jin?

369
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,830
He's dead.

370
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,590
Dead?

371
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,280
Then why were you running?

372
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,520
I stole something from him.

373
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,390
I thought you were here to catch me.

374
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,760
For a d*mn woman like you,

375
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I chased half a day for nothing!

376
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,550
Go hell!

377
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,720
This way! After her!

378
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,960
Don't let her get away!

379
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,240
Be quiet.

380
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,150
All of you split up and go search.

381
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,070
Yes!

382
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,280
Didn't I tell you to run
in the opposite direction?

383
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,870
Wanna get killed?

384
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm worried that if you get caught,

385
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,310
you'll sell me out.

386
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,760
Now it's perfect. Neither of us gets away.

387
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,150
What's that noise?

388
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,000
Go now!

389
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,790
If you tell me honestly

390
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,830
why you came here,

391
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,480
I'll spare your lives.

392
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,630
We're here

393
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,280
to hunt down Tantai Jin.

394
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,040
By whose order?

395
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,720
Is it Tantai Minglang? Where is he?

396
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,240
His…

397
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,480
They're all dead.

398
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:28,920
Your Highness,

399
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,760
since they're here for Tantai Jin,

400
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
he should be around here.

401
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,240
Please give orders to Dragon Guards to…

402
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,870
Go back.

403
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,520
Your Highness.

404
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,760
Tantai Jin is…

405
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,630
Get on the horse.

406
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,240
Take these bodies back to the city.

407
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,760
No one saw Tantai Jin today.

408
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,870
Understand?

409
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,960
Understand!

410
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,920
[Tantai Jin,]

411
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,720
[this is as far as I can get you.]

412
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,280
This place is concealed enough.

413
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,150
Let's spend the night here.

414
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,720
Why didn't you leave just now?

415
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,040
Why did you distract the soldiers
and save me?

416
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,440
That's just because…

417
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,630
Better to talk about it till we're safe.

418
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,720
No soldiers are chasing us for now.

419
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Give me back my charms.

420
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,520
If we run into them again,

421
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,110
at least I have something to defend us.

422
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,870
You drew so many sketches?

423
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,350
You only taught me this type.

424
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,350
These are useless
for the current situation.

425
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,110
And they were soaked
in water for too long.

426
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,760
There's no magic on them.

427
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,390
Meeting you is the unluckiest thing.

428
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,040
Tantai Jin,

429
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,310
why is your blood black?

430
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,920
What exactly happened to you?

431
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,680
[Once the poison in your left eye]

432
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,150
diffuses to the rest of your meridians,

433
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,110
you'll be dead
after spitting blood three times.

434
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,830
What's going on? Just tell me!

435
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,830
I was poisoned by Tantai Minglang.

436
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,040
Maybe later, I'll be dead.

437
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,150
You prick!

438
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,790
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

439
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,830
Would it help if I did?

440
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,280
Are you a doctor?
Do you have the antidote?

441
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,550
There must be a way to save you.

442
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,590
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

443
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,440
Ye Xiwu!

444
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,870
Ye Xiwu!

445
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,150
Where are you going?

446
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,870
Report!

447
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,790
The men we sent out to search

448
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,590
haven't found Tantai Jin yet.

449
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,550
Useless!

450
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,280
Your Highness,

451
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,440
urgent news from the capital.

452
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,960
Something happened in the palace.

453
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,280
They need you to handle it.

454
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,630
Please return to the capital first.

455
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,960
I'll take care of it.

456
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,630
Fine.

457
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,870
I've been out for too long this time.

458
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,310
My third brother,

459
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,720
when I find you,

460
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,590
I'll crush the bones of you

461
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,920
and Yue Ruanruan into powder.

462
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,240
I'll make you disappear for good.

463
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,150
Go.

464
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,520
Tantai Jin,

465
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,240
you can't hide much longer.

466
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,070
You must be eliminated.

467
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,550
You're awake.

468
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,550
You're back.

469
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,480
Of course.

470
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,590
You think I'll leave you alone here?

471
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,310
You're badly injured

472
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,550
and slept for hours.

473
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,390
I gave you some simple treatment.

474
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,760
Have some fruit first.

475
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,000
You're in luck.

476
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,680
I picked some herbs back.

477
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,350
They can stop the poison from spreading.

478
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,550
I'll apply them on you in a sec.

479
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,440
Well.

480
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,070
You should not try
to run around out there.

481
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,350
You got so many injuries and almost died.

482
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,070
You really scared me.

483
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,110
I must owe you in my previous life.

484
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,630
Ye Xiwu,

485
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,310
you don't need to try so hard to save me.

486
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,350
You gotta live on.

487
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,960
Are you injured somewhere else too?

488
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,630
Come on.

489
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,310
What are you doing?

490
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,960
You still mind this when you're dying?

491
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,590
What's more,

492
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,240
we're already married.

493
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,870
Nothing to be shy about.

494
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,960
Ye Xiwu,

495
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,040
you said it on the ship.

496
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,870
From now on,

497
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,960
we will have nothing
to do with each other.

498
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,480
When we get out of here,

499
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,350
I will settle scores with you properly.

500
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,000
But now your life is in my hands.

501
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,550
I will decide whether you live or not.

502
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,590
Understand,

503
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,960
Tantai Jin?

504
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,110
Okay.

505
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,960
What is this?

506
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,240
Give it back!

507
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,070
It looks like some kind of treasure.

508
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,920
Why haven't I seen it before?

509
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,920
I found it on the road.

510
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,110
I don't know what it is, either.

511
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,350
Probably worthless.

512
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,350
Give it back to me.

513
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,480
Since you found it,

514
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,110
technically, it's not yours.

515
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,870
Since it's in my hand,

516
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,350
it's mine now.

517
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,480
No! You can't hold it.

518
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,720
Ye Xiwu, be honest with me.

519
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
What exactly is this?

520
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,720
It's a lost divine artifac from ancient times.

521
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,550
It's called World-alluring Jade.

522
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,240
World-alluring Jade?

523
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,550
You'd better not
have any funny ideas about it!

524
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,350
This Jade was forged by a witch
ten thousand years ago.

525
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,000
[She killed tens of thousands
of immortals,]

526
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,590
[and withdrew their immortal bones.]

527
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,960
[Making this Jade was an evil deed.]

528
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,920
That's why its users
were doomed to end badly.

529
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,710
They'll be short-lived and die violently.

530
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,190
Bad endings… Violent death?

531
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,880
Guess you are thinking if you devour it,

532
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,360
it'll be more useful
than devouring elixirs?

533
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,040
You'd better give up this idea,

534
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,920
or you'll die a horrible death.

535
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm already deeply poisoned.

536
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,710
The poison might kick in any second.

537
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,270
I can't even keep my life now.

538
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,000
Why would I be afraid of death?

539
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,920
Why would I be afraid of some curse?

540
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,840
There's no difference

541
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,190
for me

542
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,400
whether to die now or later.

543
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,710
I won't let you die here.

544
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,880
Time to change your medicine.

545
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,790
Don't move, okay?

546
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,960
Otherwise, I might break some more ribs.

547
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,000
Done. Time to sleep.

548
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,270
I'll take you to Sheng Kingdom
tomorrow morning.

549
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,150
There must be a way to save you.

When we go through the woods ahead,

571
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,190
we'll find somewhere to rest.

572
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,560
Tantai Jin,

573
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,590
you're really not fully dead.

574
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Seems like you also made up with Miss Xiwu.

575
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,920
Who's this?

576
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,400
Tantai Minglang's subordinate.

577
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,880
She's able to use demonic hex.

578
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,360
Be careful.

579
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,520
[Tantai Jin is too weak to take any risk.]

580
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,040
[If he dies,]

581
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,670
[everything will be in vain.]

582
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,520
Tantai Jin,

583
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,520
her target is you.

584
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,590
Find a good chance to run first.

585
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,000
I'll think of a way to stall her.

586
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,520
What?

587
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,520
So deeply poisoned
that you can't use any hex?

588
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,630
Seeing me

589
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,000
means you two lovebirds' tragic ending

590
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,790
has come.

591
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,230
What are you going to fight her with?

592
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,080
Just leave it to me.

593
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,560

Are you okay?

596
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,520
Tantai Jin,

597
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,520

598

599
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,920

She'll be dead in no time.

609

613
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,670

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,950
I'm not hungry.

19
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,590
I'm going to take a nap.

20
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,800
Remember to finish it while it's hot
after marking your memorials.

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,560
Ye Xiwu,

22
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,680
have you fallen asleep?

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,560
Did you cook this porridge

24
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,710
for me specifically?

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm asking you

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,190
whether you made

27
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
this porridge especially for me.

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,910
That's right.

29
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,310
Have you taken it?

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,560
Do you want me to take it?

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,910
What's the matter?

32
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,280
I guess I'll have some

33
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,120
if you feed me.

34
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,870
I want you to feed me.

35
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,030
(Tantai Jin, you're scaring me.)

36
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,120
Why are you being so mushy

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,310
out of the blue?

38
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,630
Open your mouth.

39
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,360
Scholar Pang,

40
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,480
do we still wait?

41
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes.

42
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,480
His Highness ordered us

43
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,830
to lead the main army down south

44
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,070
if he didn't return on time.

45
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
I will go against his order.

46
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,070
At most, I'll receive military punishment

47
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,190
when Xiao Lin comes back.

48
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,240
Head to the camp and ask the soldiers.

49
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,240
Those who are willing to stay

50
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,720
and wait for Prince Lin

51
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,800
can stay here.

52
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,680
As for the rest, you can
escape to the South with them.

53
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,310
Miss Xiwu, do you feel unwell?

54
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,040
Xiao Lin?

55
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,830
Have we managed to escape?

56
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,560
That's right.

57
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,510
Miss Xiwu,

58
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,360
you don't look too good.

59
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,190
Please hang in there.

60
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,040
Let's find a place

61
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,510
and rest there before dawn.

62
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,950
Your Majesty.

63
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,830
Do you have the result?

64
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,560
Traces of dry mylabris
were found in the porridge.

65
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
It's a type of deadly poison
from the Sheng Kingdom.

66
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,750
What will happen if I take it?

67
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,680
It will kill you instantly.

68
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,750
And,

69
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,310
there is no antidote for it.

70
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,680
Ye Xiwu,

71
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,190
did you try to poison me?

72
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
So, you wish to assassinate me?

73
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,240
Didn't you say that you liked me

74
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,190
and wanted to stay beside me?

75
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,840
Why?

76
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
Why did you do so?

77
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,750
Nian Baiyu,

78
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,960

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,120

Ye Xiwu.

83
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,840
Wake up.

84
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,240
Yes, master.

85
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,440
You can do whatever you want now.

86
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Yes.

87
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,320
Ye Xiwu,

88
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,750
were you looking for this?

89
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,910
Tell me.

90
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,870
What do you want to do with it?

91
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,120
To save Xiao Lin.

92
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,080
Ye Xiwu,

93
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,630
did you poison the porridge?

94
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes, I did.

95
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,750
So, you did everything
for Xiao Lin's sake?

96
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,080
That's right.

97
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,150
Do you love him?

98
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,360
You're actually
willing to do this for him?

99
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,270
You're willing to kill me for his sake?

100
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,550
Go now.

101
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,440
Tail her.

102
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,960
Let her achieve her goal.

103
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,630
Ye Xiwu,

105
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,910
you said you wouldn't leave me.

106
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,960
It's too late for you to regret it.

107
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,910
Put it on.

108
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
It can keep you warm more or less.

109
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,150
Thanks.

110
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,550
Here.

111
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,790
I'm afraid Tantai Jin's soldiers

112
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,080
will leave town soon.

113
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,320
We can't afford to take
official routes along the way.

114
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,840
Xiao Lin,

115
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,240
how did we manage to escape?

116
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,550
I feel a little blurry.

117
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,750
Miss Xiwu, sorry for this.

118
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,720
You have a fever.

119
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,240
Maybe it's because you were frightened

120
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,510
and caught a cold during nighttime.

121
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
You poisoned Tantai Jin

122
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,320
and stole the Tiger Tally.

123
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,480
Due to that, we had access
to all city gates.

124
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,510
That was how we made it out.

125
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,550
Everything was proceeding so smoothly

126
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,080
that I felt something was off.

127
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,720
(There are no pursuers or stalkers
behind our tail.)

128
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,960
(Tantai Jin, what exactly are you up to?)

129
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,320
I want you to feed me.

130
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,080
Open your mouth.

131
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:51,960
That's right.

132
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,480
I remember now.

133
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,120
This is great.

134
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,870
I finally got you out of there.

135
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,720
Miss Xiwu,

136
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,550
you saved my life.

137
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,440
No words can express my gratitude.

138
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,240
I feel much better now.

139
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,080
You should leave.

140
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,600
Tantai Jin will wake up after dawn.

141
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,720
We should leave together.

142
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,030
You stole the Tiger Tally.

143
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,440
Tantai Jin won't let you off.

144
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,750
You mustn't head back.

145
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,120
Miss Xiwu,

146
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,630
we should head to the army camp first.

147
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,480
We need to plan things out.

148
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,790
I have to go back.

149
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,120
I haven't accomplished my mission.
I have to return to his side.

150
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,750
But you're right.

151
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,910
Tantai Jin will be infuriated

152
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,630
if I return now.

153
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,480
I will lay low for a while.

154
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,790
I'll head back

155
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,550
once he cools off.

156
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
So, where are we heading now?

157
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,600
The South.

158
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,750
The South?

159
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,320
Do you two intend to leave
the Jing Kingdom together?

160
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,080
What a shame.

161
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,320
You can never

162
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,000
escape from me for the rest of your life.

163
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,550
What's the matter?

164
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,910
Your Majesty,

165
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,630
we received a message
outside of the palace.

166
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,630
Something had happened to the Ye family!

167
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,720
Hurry! The imperial physician is here!

168
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,360
Hurry!

169
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,750
How is it?

170
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
Her Ladyship was struck by lethal poison.

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm afraid

172
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,360
there's no cure for it…

173
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,320
Aren't you an imperial physician?

174
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,510
You have to do something!

175
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,360
Her Ladyship was poisoned by dry mylabris.

176
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,750
This is…

177
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,720
Grandma!

178
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,790
Grandma, please wake up!

179
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,390
(How is he still alive?)

180
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,030
Grandma!

181
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,080
Your Majesty.

182
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,590
Your Majesty, why have you
graced us with your presence?

183
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,070
Mother!

184
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,400
What do you want to say?

185
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,880
Xiwu!

186
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,790
Xiwu!

187
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,880
Mother,

188
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,830
what do you want to say?

189
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,200
Your Ladyship,

190
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,270
don't worry.

191
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,240
I'll surely take care of Ye Xiwu

192
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,270
and won't let her suffer any grievances.

193
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,790
I promise.

194
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,110
Grandma!

195
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,160
Grandma!

196
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,880
-Grandma!
-Mother!

197
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,680
-Grandma!
-Mother!

198
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
Mother!

199
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,550
-Grandma, wake up!
-Mother!

200
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,510
Grandma!

201
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,160
Grandma!

202
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,590
Mother!

203
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,920
Grandma!

204
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,750
Grandma!

205
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,920
Ye Bingchang,

206
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,510
tragedy has befallen your family.

207
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,920
You don't need to return
to the concubine house.

208
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,750
Stay here and take care of your family.

209
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,240
-Grandma!
-Your Majesty.

210
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,160
-Mother!
-Your Majesty.

211
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,000
The porridge Grandma took in the evening

212
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,030
was drugged.

213
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,680
The imperial physician concluded

214
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,440
that it was dry mylabris.

215
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Bingchang said the porridge was made
by Xiwu herself.

216
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,440
Grandma.

217
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,030
She served Grandma a bowl of it.

218
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,200
Ye Xiwu,

219
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,070
did you make this porridge
especially for me?

220
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,830
Traces of dry mylabris
were found in the porridge.

221
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,960
It's a type of deadly poison
from the Sheng Kingdom.

222
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,510
Open your mouth.

223
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,750
Your Majesty,

224
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,240
Xiwu would never poison Grandma.

225
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,680
Grandma must have eaten
the poisoned porridge by accident

226
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,400
and died as a result.

227
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,270
I'm afraid we need to find out

228
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,790
who the poisoned porridge
was prepared for.

229
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,720
There's no need for that.

230
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,270
It was me.

231
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,510
Why?

232
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
It's impossible, Dad.

233
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,160
It can't be Xiwu.

234
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,790
Grandma!

235
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,400
Your Majesty!

236
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,550
Your Majesty!

237
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,350
Grandma!

238
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,550
Ye Xiwu,

239
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,240
time for you to be abandoned by all.

240
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,960
We've finally arrived.

241
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,880
Arrived?

242
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,640
But there's not a single soul here.

243
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,160
We're four days late.

244
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,720
Maybe they've already left.

245
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,400
Let's go take a look first.

246
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,830
Your Highness.

247
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,070
Junior Sect Uncle.

248
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,880
Thank god you're still alive!

249
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,680
I knew you could make it back.

250
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,270
So you defied my order

251
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,350
and waited for another four days?

252
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,070
Yeah.

253
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,440
I've foreseen it.

254
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,440
Welcome back, Your Highness.

255
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,350
Miss Xiwu is also here.

256
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,880
Did you escape by yourself

257
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,480
and took her along with you?

258
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,270
Tantai Jin's gonna be so mad.

259
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,680
Alright.

260
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,790
I can get out of there alive

261
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,550
all thanks to Miss Xiwu's assistance.

262
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,480
You should thank her, Junior Sect Uncle.

263
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,200
Xiwu, what happened to you?

264
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,680
Xiwu?

265
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,270
Ye Xiwu, wake up.

266
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Wake up.

267
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,000
Ye Xiwu,

268
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,920
you'll be back soon.

269
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,350
I'll be waiting for you.

270
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,000
You have nowhere else to be

271
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,310
except by my side.

272
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,510
Your Highness!

273
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,440
Your Highness!

274
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,590
Miss Xiwu,

275
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,110
why did you do this?

276
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,790
You followed him all the way here

277
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,830
just to assassinate His Highness

278
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,270
for Tantai Jin?

279
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,750
Miss Xiwu,

280
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,960
how could you do this?

281
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,590
Your Highness.

282
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,350
Ye Xiwu,

283
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,200
even if you will hate me,

284
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,590
even if you will never forget me,

285
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,960
I'll make you stay by my side

286
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,270
to keep me company.

287
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,400
Your Majesty,

288
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,880
you clearly knew what Miss Xiwu would do.

289
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,590
Why did you let her stab Xiao Lin

290
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,240
after the two of them met the Sheng remnants?

291
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,400
Only by letting her betray Xiao Lin

292
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,240
in front of everybody's eyes,

293
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,070
can she be discarded by all

294
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,510
and have nowhere to go.

295
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,480
They will hate her.

296
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,720
Pang Yizhi will hate her.

297
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,640
Xiao Lin will hate her more.

298
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,400
But with the protection of the puppetry barrier,

299
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,270
nobody can hurt her.

300
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,880
She can only return to Jing.

301
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,440
Return to me.

302
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,790
Because there's only me who can protect her,

303
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,640
keep her company,

304
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,920
and love her.

305
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,750
Relay my order to the troops:

306
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,310
catch Xiao Lin and Ye Xiwu.

307
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,960
Remember,

308
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,440
keep them alive.

309
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:36,880
Yes.

310
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
Ye Xiwu,

311
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,640
I'll wait for your return.

312
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,550
Let her go.

313
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,160
Your Highness!

314
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,680
I said let Miss Xiwu go.

315
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,550
I'm sorry.

316
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,110
I didn't do it on purpose.

317
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,830
I didn't know why.

318
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
I… I didn't mean it.

319
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,030
Xiwu,

320
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,160
don't be afraid.

321
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,640
It's not fatal.

322
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,590
I won't die for now.

323
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,790
Junior Sect Uncle,

324
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,510
help me get up.

325
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,070
Listen up.

326
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,480
I was hurt by Jing soldiers.

327
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm fine now.

328
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,960
It has nothing to do with Miss Xiwu.

329
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Nobody must talk about this.

330
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Remember that?

331
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,440
Yes.

332
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,160
Let's go.

333
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,830
Did you accommodate Miss Xiwu?

334
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,160
I've undo her spell.

335
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,070
She wanted to come look after you.

336
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,830
I stopped her.

337
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,240
This is called Soul-gnawing Wedge.

338
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
It sucks blood from the victim.

339
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,590
After many days,

340
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,030
the victim may die from weakness.

341
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,000
What if I dig it out

342
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,240
with a dagger?

343
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,590
You must be kidding.

344
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,200
Listen to me.

345
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,200
You gotta be lying in bed everyday.

346
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,830
Waiting for death?

347
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,200
I'll figure out a way.

348
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,480
We don't have time.

349
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,440
Have you thought of this?

350
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,960
He could've killed me

351
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,070
by using Ye Xiwu as his puppet,

352
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,030
but why did he only immobilize me?

353
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,960
What is this for?

354
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,310
What exactly happened?

355
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,720
Ye Xiwu, wake up.

356
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,640
Xiao Lin's gonna be okay, isn't he?

357
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,960
Why are you walking around

358
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,070
instead of being resting in your room?

359
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,550
Why did you change your outfit?

360
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,310
Someone will prepare a carriage

361
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,550
to send you out of here later.

362
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,400
Where are you sending me?

363
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,160
Just somewhere to lay low.

364
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Don't worry.

365
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,750
The Dragon Guards will keep you safe.

366
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,310
There's a war coming, isn't it?

367
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,480
How can you fight when you're injured?

368
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,790
Just let me stay.

369
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,070
It's all my fault.

370
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,240
I can't just walk away.

371
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,590
Xiao Lin,

372
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,030
are you hiding something from me?

373
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,880
News just came from the capital.

374
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,720
I thought about it back and forth.

375
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,480
I guess I'd better tell you.

376
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,350
What news?

377
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,590
Your grandma

378
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,720
passed away.

379
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,920
That's impossible.

380
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,200
Did your men made a mistake?

381
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,720
Calm down.

382
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,070
You men must made a mistake.

383
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,070
Grandma has always been healthy.

384
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,070
She's perfectly fine when I left.

385
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,830
Xiwu,

386
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,240
If this thing happened because of me,

387
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,030
I must take responsibility for it.

388
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,680
I can only repay what I owe

389
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,590
to your grandma in my next life.

390
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,240
Why did it happen because of you?

391
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,400
Last night Tantai Jin went to the Ye family.

392
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,750
Grandma.

393
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,310
It's all fake.

394
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,270
He just learned how to pretend.

395
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,480
It's Tantai Jin.

396
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,160
Tantai Jin.

397
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,880
Tantai Jin!

398
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,550
Xiwu,

399
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,960
my condolences.

400
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't have too much time to stay.

401
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,160
You can't stay here, either.

402
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,750
where are you going?

403
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,030
Your Majesty, according to your order,

404
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,750
the pigeon letter will arrive today.

405
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,550
Okay.

406
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,790
I'll be expecting the good news.

407
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,070
Your Majesty,

408
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,110
why don't you just kill Xiao Lin?

409
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,960
I have my own plans.

410
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,030
Yes.

411
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,350
I've just received His Majesty's pigeon letter.

412
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,590
It says Xiao Lin is too injured to lead his army.

413
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,000
Launch a surprise attack at dusk,

414
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,160
and we'll be able to catch him alive.

415
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,400
Prepare for it immediately.

416
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,640
By His Majesty's order,

417
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,240
Ye Xiwu and Xiao Lin

418
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,590
must be captured alive.

419
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,000
This is the Virid Blood Pill.

420
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,920
It'll stop your bleeding

421
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,830
and keep you alive temporarily.

422
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,240
I didn't expect there's

423
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,640
someone like you who courts death.

424
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,550
Thanks, Junior Sect Uncle.

425
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,400
Go call together the officers for me.

426
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,710
Stop the carriage!

427
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,760
Send me back!

428
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,880
Xiao Lin's gonna die!

429
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,920
By His Highness's order,

430
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,440
I must take you away from the battle field.

431
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,110
Chongyu, help me.

432
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,760
Please.

433
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,110
Your Majesty.

434
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,760
Speak.

435
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,630
Your Majesty,

436
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,280
General Feng led three troops

437
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,360
to surround the headquarters of Sheng army.

438
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,150
But…

439
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,550
He didn't catch Xiao Lin.

440
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,590
They escaped?

441
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,400
No.

442
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,880
We surrounded the Sheng troops,

443
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,630
but Xiao Lin led his remnants and broke through.

444
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,110
He launched a raid from behind

445
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,030
and caught us unaware.

446
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,710
He burned all of our provisions.

447
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,000
He even rescued all the prisoners.

448
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,280
Impossible.

449
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,960
Xiao Lin was stabbed by the Soul-gnawing Wedge.

450
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,070
He can't even get on the horseback.

451
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,920
How can he lead his army?

452
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,880
Did someone see this with their own eyes?

453
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,760
Yes.

454
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,710
All of our soldiers saw it.

455
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,510
It's absolutely true.

456
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,230
He led his remnants

457
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,630
and the refugees and headed south.

458
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,760
But he left this in his camp.

459
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,320
Show me.

460
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,110
Yes.

461
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,510
Brother Tantai,

462
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,760
no,

463
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,670
I should address you as Your Majesty now.

464
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,070
Back when we're in the Sheng palace,

465
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,510
I was a prince and you were a hostage.

466
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,280
Our paths were nothing alike.

467
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,360
When you left the palace and got married,

468
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,960
we're separated and rarely met.

469
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,400
Another year later,

470
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,670
who'd have thought we will be at war

471
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,190
and become each other's archenemy.

472
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,030
Now what separates us will be

473
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,000
the boundary of life and death.

474
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,280
Jing Kingdom is on the rise.

475
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,230
Sheng Kingdom has perished.

476
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,550
But there are still loyal civilians and officers

477
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,880
who choose to follow me.

478
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,230
I've ordered my troops
to escort these refugees southward

479
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,070
and travel far by sea.

480
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,550
Now the world belongs to Jing Kingdom.

481
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,960
My land and people will be yours, too.

482
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,110
They say a kingdom rises

483
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,630
because it values its people.

484
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
A kingdom perishes

485
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,840
because it acts the opposite.

486
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,440
I wish that you would treat kindly

487
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,000
this beautiful land and these good folks.

488
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,440
Thanks for granting my wish.

489
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,840
I've nothing else to offer

490
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,710
but this ultimate treasure Heart-guarding Scale.

491
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,400
Please take it as a congratulatory gift.

492
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,190
Xiao Lin,

493
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,710
you're congratulating me like this?

494
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,510
Miss Xiwu,

495
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,760
how come you're back?

496
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,440
Miss Xiwu.

497
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,230
Why are you hanging the memorial banners?

498
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,280
Who's gone?

499
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,480
Also, I have another request.

500
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,710
Bingchang is sensitive and jealous.

501
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,150
Now she's lost her husband.

502
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,510
I'm afraid her life will be difficult.

503
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,400
Although I've cut all ties with her,

504
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,510
I wish that you could spare her life.

505
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,030
My highest respect

506
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,960
and best regards

507
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,880
Xiao Lin

508
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,920
Why are you so stubborn?

509
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,070
Why do you have to sacrifice yourself?

510
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,880
Zhong Tai and Chen Xian will lead

511
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,110
the remnants to leave the camp

512
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,280
and sail south after dark.

513
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,230
What about you?

514
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,670
I don't know.

515
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,030

[Episode 24]

17
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,230
Your Majesty,

18
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,070
since I returned from Sheng Kingdom,

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,150
Xiao Lin and I have already
broken off our relationship completely.

20
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,790
Bingchang, you…

21
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,790
But

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,560
your husband has deep feelings for you.

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Xiao Lin risked his life
to come and assassinate me tonight,

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
luring all the guards to me

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
in order to help you escape.

26
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,400
Even I couldn't help
but be moved by such loyalty.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,240
I wonder, Mrs. Xuancheng,
what are your thoughts on this?

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
No matter what Xiao Lin does,

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,430
I have nothing to do with it.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,240
My heart is only
devoted to you, Your Majesty,

31
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,150
and will remain unchanged
throughout my life.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,120
Really?

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,240
I swear on my life.

34
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,310
Haven't you been well with Bingchang?

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,150
Why did she say such words?

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Alright, you may stand up.

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,590
You are the hero today,

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,560
and I should reward you.

39
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,840
What's General Ye doing here?

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,190
To give a hand?

41
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,120
Qingyu,

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,910
go ahead.

43
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,630
When I was at the Vermilion Bird Gate,

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,150
I saw Bingchang and Pian Ran

45
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,000
and heard them arguing.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,960
I stopped Pian Ran
before she hit Bingchang.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
Arguing for what?

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
About love threads.

49
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,000
Pian Ran, what are love threads?

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,000
Anyone with spiritual intelligence
would have love threads.

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,470
It is through love threads
that we are able to love others.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
But I lost my love threads.

53
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,240
How did you lose them?

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,560
Why should I tell you?

55
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,800
Fine.

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,150
Then you tell me.

57
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,910
I…

58
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,960
I don't know what they are talking about.

59
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,040
Is that so?

60
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,040
Baiyu,

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,630
I heard

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,560
recently, the Moonshadow Guards
have developed a new demonic poison.

63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,870
It can cause a person to

64
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,800
die a painful death within ten days,

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,270
but it also makes
them unable to keep any secrets.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,430
I heard that it is quite effective.

67
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,160
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,270
Mrs. Xuancheng,
if you don't want to tell the truth,

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
you shall try the new poison for me.

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,560
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,800
you just gave me credit

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,720
and wanted to reward me.

74
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,680
They are not the same thing.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,270
You can use the credit
to offset your mistakes.

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,870
After you try the poison,

77
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,270
I can consider keeping you alive.

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
Are you going to spit the truth,

79
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,160
or do you want to take the poison first?

80
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,870
I will tell the truth.

81
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,120
It happened seven years ago.

82
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,360
At that time, I had just turned 16

83
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,600
and was proud and arrogant.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Jiahui,

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,560
am I similar to this wildflower?

86
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,750
So weak and invisible…

87
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,310
In the Great General's
flourishing mansion,

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,600
who would notice

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
such an unremarkable wildflower?

90
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,040
Miss, don't say that.

91
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,680
You are beautiful and talented,

92
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,720

the perfect man someday.

93

94
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,630
ever deserve a perfect husband?

95
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,430
Jiahui,

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,310
go to the temple
and ask for a safety charm on my behalf.

97
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,310
Hand it over to Grandma for me.

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,120
How about you, Miss?

99
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,830
It's not far from the city gate here.

100
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,750
I will walk back,

101
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,830

102
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,190

The promises of eternal love

Only when I am dead,

333
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,400
and the hope of
Sheng Kingdom's revival is shattered,

334
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,680
can this war truly end

335

338
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,790
Yeah. We all have our aspirations.

339
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,790
Don't feel sad for me, Miss Xiwu.

340
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,750
Just wait here.

341
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,070
Within six days, I'll figure out a way

342
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,110
to let you leave with the Sheng army.

343
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,240
This is too risky.

344
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,880
Please don't take any chances.

345

Wait for my news.

Actually,

348
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,070
you're not Ye Xiwu, right?

349
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,680
Why did you say that?

350
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,590
I've known Ye Xiwu since little.

351
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,550
She wouldn't fight for others

352
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,030
or go on a mission alone.

353
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,790
Not to mention
risking her life to save me.

After Bo're Life,

355

when we're parting by the Mohe River,

356
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,880
I was already certain of it.

No need to explain.

359
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,680
This must be a most mysterious thing

360

not to be told to others.

361
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,680
Rest assured.
I won't mention it to anyone,

362
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,750

For how long?

A quarter of an hour at most.

367
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,550
What did they talk about?

368
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,200
I was too far away to hear clearly.

At least you could see clearly.

Miss Ye dragged his clothes vigorously.

376
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,920
And then Miss Ye left.

377

I asked Xiwu for help.

She is quite favored

395

by His Majesty.

That's why I can come to see you.

We've all heard about what you did.

It's fair to be punished
for your mistakes.

399

But blood is thicker than water.

You're one of our family, after all.

Come, take this.

It's the hand ointment.

bring it to you.

She said that it's cold in Jing Kingdom.

419
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,790
So Tantai Jin told the imperial doctors

to make up this ointment

You can't buy this anywhere else.

She specially spared some

Remember to apply it often every day.

After all,

Xiwu still cares about her elder sister.

it's my mother's death anniversary

Although I've failed
to be a good daughter,

I still wish to go home

could you discuss this with Xiwu?

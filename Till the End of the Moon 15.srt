in demonic cultivation.

170
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,070
It's normal that you can't change so soon.

171
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,160
There's no need to hurry.

172

[Ming Ye!]

[you must
take care of yourself in the future.]

176
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,350
No one can resist me!

177
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,920
Not even you, God of War!

178
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,400
I said I wouldn't kill you,
and I won't break my promise.

179
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,270
But I will turn you
into a demonic flood dragon

180
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,510
for me to command.

181
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,200
And I'll let you
slaughter the three worlds.

182
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,920
And kill all of your associates!

183
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,880
What a pity. Your wish won't be granted.

184
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,680
I said you couldn't escape.

185
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,200
Activate the array!

186
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,400
Is this all you can do
with the gods' skills and the celestial power?

187
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,350
Why do you betray me?

188
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,640
You promised me you'd spare her.

189
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,310
Now she's dead.

190
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,750
So you're just as foolish as them!

191
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,070
I will seal you

192

193

The Devil God is finally killed!

194
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,200
Worth exhausting all of our powers.

195

[Everything]

You stole my evil bone.

198
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,240
You used
the Celestial Punishment to kill me!

199
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,640
I won't have mercy on you!

200
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,550
When heaven and earth collapse,

201
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,880
when the three realms return to chaos,

202
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,160
I wonder how

203
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,240
your Shangqing Realm would become?

204
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,750
The God of War has lost his power,

205
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,400
but the Devil God is still alive.

206
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,400
Now the Heavenly Pillars
are collapsed and all lives are doomed.

207
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
Looks like,

208
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,750
we can only use the last resort.

209
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,680
All gods return to the ruins
to protect Heaven and Earth!

210

The gods and demons
fought at Mount Changze.

340

Why don't I take him
back to Yuqing Palace?

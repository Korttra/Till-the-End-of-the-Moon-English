The doctor said
she had been so close to death.

24

of the Sheng

38

but a disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.

39
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,520
I came to make divination for you

40

No.

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,960
I can't hold anything back,

47

or I'm gonna explode.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,190
From the divination image,

51
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,360
you'll suddenly lose your love

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,150
and regret in your entire life.

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,710
Cannot reclaim your love
and be trapped in the underworld.

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,750
It seems you don't want
your tongue anymore.

I haven't finished my words.

58

There are two chances showed
in the divination image.

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,000
One is about thunder.
The other is about water.

61

I'm not proficient.

63
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,920
Sorry I can't explain it.

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,120
What do you want to exchange it for?

65
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,630
I want a bottle of your heart blood.

66
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,480
Scholar Pang.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,120
What makes you

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,070
think I would give it

69

to you

70
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,750

71
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,360
You have the whole world under you.

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,070
Of course, I'm not fully confident

73
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,950
that you would give it.

74
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,240
However, I have a thunder-series artifact.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,920

76
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,750
I'll repay you with it.

What's it?

78
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,040
This is Yin-Yang Twin Bracelets,

79
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,430
made from thunder iron.

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
It's an artifact of Xiaoyao Sect.

81
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,310
When two people wear one of the bracelets,

82
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,190
the owner of Ying bracelet won't die

83

if the owner of Yang bracelet is alive.

84
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,360
The reason is

85
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,920
that the lifespan
of the owner of Yang bracelet

86
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,630
has offset the disasters
of the owner of Ying bracelet.

87
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,920
Yet, once you put on the bracelet,

88
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,750
you won't take it off.

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,270
[Li Susu.]

173
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,380
[Ji Ze.]

174
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,740
[I failed to kill Devil God.]

175
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,150
[I've let down your trust.]

176
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,870
[Sorry.]

177
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,020
You not only feel guilty to me,

178
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,390
but also feel guilty to Tantai Jin.

179
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,390
Right?

180
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,500
[Guilty?]

181
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
I'm surprised

182
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,390
that he was convinced
that I wanted to poison him

183
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,720
but he still wanted to marry me

184
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,030
and be with me forever.

185
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,500
Ji Ze.

186
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,440
Whether he is a demon or a god,

187
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,030
since he loves me deeply,

188
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,340
how can I not be guilty?

189
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,870
[Silly...]

190
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,030
[I tell you,]

191
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,550
[even if so many people]

192
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,220
[hadn't died because of]

193
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,020
[you and Tantai Jin,]

194
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,500
[this would be how you and Tantai Jin end.]

195
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,980
Li Susu.

196
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,910
In your lifetime,

197
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
the fate of you two has already been doomed.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,720
Whatever you do, you won't change it.

199
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
If you don't want to owe him,

200
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,150
you have to owe the world.

201
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,080
In Barren Abyss,

202
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,750
I mentioned

203
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,030
a dream, a drop of tear

204
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,390
and a strand of silk.

205
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,870
Have you understood them?

206
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,000
The tear is Soul-slaying Teardrop.

207
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,120
The silk is the affection silk
of Tantai Jin.

208
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,030
The dream...

209
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,750
Is it Bo're Life?

210
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,150
Since you've guessed right,

211
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,790
why haven't you woken up yet?

212
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,510
What do you mean?

213
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,550
What are you doing?

214
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,440
Sang Jiu.

215
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,240
I'll take the punishment for you.

216
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,440
When my immortal body vanishes,

217
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,630
my divine essence
will replace your demon bone.

218
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,440
Ming Ye.

219
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,840
Let go of me!

220
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,200
The divine essence
will replace the demon bone.

221
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,670
The divine essence
will replace the demon bone.

222
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,600
Everything happens for a reason.

223
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,550
Don't indulge in foolishness.

224
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,030
Seize the chance.

225
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,390
[The divine essence
will replace the demon bone.]

226
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,150
[If he loses the evil bone,]

227
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,870
[Devil God won't return to life.]

228
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,910
[With the power of the thunder,]

229
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,910
[Ming Ye replaced my demon bone
with his divine essence.]

230
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,320
[So similarly, I can replace evil bone
with divine essence.]

231
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,200
[But now my body has no power,]

232
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,270
[let alone divine essence.]

233
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
[What should I do?]

234
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,360
[That hurts.]

235
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
[With my weak body,]

236
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,120
[how can I build divine essence]

237
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,870
[to trigger thundering?]

238
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,440
It's a gem
that I forged with the divine essence

239
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,360
of the entire Flying Serpent clan.

240
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,120
This tiny piece

241
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,870
contains the powers of immortals.

242
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,440
It's capable
of overturning heaven and earth.

243
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Why don't I call it
World-overturning Jade?

244
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,390
[World-overturning Jade.]

245
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,080
[That explains it.]

246
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,030
[That's the succession
of cause and effect.]

247
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
[What's this place?]

248
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,870
[This place looks so familiar.]

249
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,440
[I feel I've been here.]

250
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,080
[This is where Tantai Jin lived
when he was little.]

251
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,080
[This is Chilly Ward.]

252
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,550
[Have you ever seen your mom?]

253
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,670
[I haven't either.]

254
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,120
[They say I don't have mom.]

255
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,150
[Yue Ruanruan.]

256
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,600
You're awake.

257
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,870
How are you feeling?

258
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,550
Here.

259
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Eat the medicine.

260
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,030
What's the bracelet for?

261
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,600
Why can't I take it off?

262
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,320
I don't know it.

263
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,600
It looks like a divine weapon or artifact.

264
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,440
Did Tantai Jin put it on you

265
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,270
to stop you from escaping?

266
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,910
I won't escape.

267
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,270
Then eat the medicine

268
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,630
and get well.

269
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,600
Being alive is the most important thing.

270
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,640
They said you didn't eat or drink.

271
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,160
I thought you didn't want medicine

272
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,720
but want to die.

273
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,440
How can it be?

274
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Good.

275
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,830
I've lived for so long

276
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,200
and have known
that where there is life,

277
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,920
there is hope.

278
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,790
Cheer up.

279
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,720
[If I go all out to absorb power
from World-overturning Jade,]

280
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,160
[I'll definitely be retaliated heavily.]

281
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,310
[Even if I die,]

282
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,640
[I mustn't die]

283
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,550
[before completing these thing.]

284
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
[Ji Ze's barrier won't last long.]

285
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,240
[I have to speed up.]

286
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,960
[Your Majesty.]

287
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,480
[This is the elixir refined
by the warlocks today.]

288
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
Your life is reduced for Ye Xiwu.

289
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,270
I'll make the warlocks refine elixirs

290
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,070
day and night

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,440
to extend your life.

292
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,590
This is a drop in the bucket.

293
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,400
But it's might be good.

294
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,110
If I'm still alive,

295
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,310
Ye Xiwu won't die.

296
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,590
She mustn't die.

297
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm not done with her.

298
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,590
Your Majesty.

299
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,720
It seems Ye Xiwu
doesn't want to suicide anymore.

300
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,590
She ate the meals we sent today.

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,720
Did she?

302
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,030
Yes, your Majesty.

303
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,590
Why don't you go see her?

304
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,830
Ask her about the origin of the spikes,

305
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,270
so that we can find out
how to pull them out.

306
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,440
Nian Baiyu.

307
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,720
As long as she's alive,

308
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
I don't want to know if she has meals

309
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,790
or anything like that.

310
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,550
I'm not interested.

311
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,830
Yes.

312
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,920
[What a pity.]

313
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,830
[When I'm retaliated by World-overturning Jade,]

314
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,110
[I won't see the stars clearly.]

315
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,920
[Will I]

316
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,960
[not be able to see his face clearly?]

317
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
[Tantai Jin.]

318
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,590
[I've owed you in the lifetime.]

319
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,510
[But now my life]

320
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,550
[doesn't belong only to me anymore.]

321
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,960
[I will]

322
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,000
[repay you with my life.]

323
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,200
[As expected,]

324
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,510
[with World-overturning Jade,]

325
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,000
[my cultivation has advanced considerably.]

326
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,440
[If I speed it up,]

327
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,590
[the divine essence
should be completed soon.]

328
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,510
[It was almost there.]

329
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,790
His Majesty has been
working diligently lately.

330
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,200
Old guys like us can't keep up with him, huh?

331
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,590
But isn't His Majesty too harsh with

332
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,920
regulating us officials lately?

333
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,510
[Chenming Hall]
My heart already belongs to you.

334
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,350
[Chenming Hall]
It's more than a bad mood.

335
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,750
His Majesty seems

336
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,960
to have health issues these days.

337
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,750
Could the rumor be true that His Majesty's

338
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,680
meridians are badly injured and will die soon?

339
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,920
Don't say that.

340
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go.

341
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
This puppetry spell

342
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,180
is recorded in Yiyue Tribe's ancient books.

343
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,610
But it usually can only control one person.

344
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,460
After I improve it with Chixiao Sect's

345
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,570
instrument forging methods,

346
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,420
you will be able to control thousands.

347
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,330
Mighty Ruo Water,

348
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,330
control the souls.

349
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,810
Wake up.

350
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,180
Wake up.

351
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,370
Wake up.

352
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,570
These civilians King Sheng sent us

353
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,570
will be your soldiers to fight for you

354
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,850
and listen to your commands.

355
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,260
Congratulations, Your Highness.

356
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,180
With the ten thousand Nether Soldiers,

357
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,770
our great plan will definitely succeed.

358
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,770
Your Majesty,

359
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,180
recently in the southern borders,

360
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,420
suspicious people have been seen again.

361
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,180
They turn civilians into puppet demonic soldiers

362
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,610
and wreak havoc everywhere.

363
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,180
They are large in number

364
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,500
and no longer small groups like before.

365
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,740
Did you find out who's behind this?

366
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,700
According to the scouts,

367
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,500
the southern borders are covered by miasma.

368
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,020
The source of these demonic soldiers

369
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,810
seems to be deep in the poisonous miasma.

370
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,530
They can't probe deeper.

371
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,180
Since only Sheng civilians are involved,

372
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,020
most ministers think this can be ignored.

373
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,020
Although they are remnants of Sheng,

374
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,500
they're people of Jing now.

375
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,290
Go investigate immediately.

376
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,090
Yes.

377
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,700
Your Majesty,

378
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,420
there's another thing.

379
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,610
What is it?

380
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,810
Ye Xiwu was found unconscious
on the ground this morning.

381
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,220
Now she has come to herself.

382
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,330
We couldn't find out the cause.

383
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,980
We can only presume it's due to her weak body.

384
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,330
Also,

385
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,020
her hearing seems to have declined.

386
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,460
And she has poor eyesight.

387
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,020
Could be due to long time of living indoors.

388
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,090
Your Majesty, please send a doctor to treat her.

389
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
No need to report

390
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,740
as long as she's not dead.

391
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,500
Why is the water filled?

392
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,660
When did this happen?

393
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,330
Congratulations, your spell is completed.

394
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,290
Now with the Ruo Water Puppets to fight for you,

395
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,180
you can devour the demonic energy without limit.

396
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,090
You can definitely kill Tantai Jin

397
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,940
and get back to the throne.

398
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,420
You don't need to comfort me.

399
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,770
I'm perfectly aware.

400
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,770
Swallowing the demonic elixir
and devouring the demonic energy

401
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,050
is the cause of me looking like this now.

402
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,020
My days are numbered.

403
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,370
I'll die soon.

404
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,700
All this is because I don't accept my fate.

405
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,530
I'll do anything

406
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,020
to fulfill my ambition.

407
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,530
But you...

408
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,260
You've been following me since I was young.

409
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,570
I must thank you.

410
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,610
I've been following you

411
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,260
since you were young

412
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,220
and weren't made crown prince.

413
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,530
I'm willing to follow you till the end.

414
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,850
Spread the news that I'm on the southern borders.

415
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,850
When Tantai Jin knows,

416
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,570
he'll definitely come personally.

417
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,530
I'll drag him into hell with me.

418
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,740
This fight of me and him

419
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,050
won't stop till death.

420
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,700
It can never be reconciled.

421
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,290
Since you have such resolution,

422
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,940
you'll definitely make it.

423
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,330
I'm willing to assist you with my life.

424
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,700
My men, listen!

425
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,290
Let's go to war!

426
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,090
Your Majesty,

427
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,810
we've found that the mastermind behind the

428
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,130
demonic soldiers is indeed Tantai Minglang.

429
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,130
Now he's hiding on the southern borders

430
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,290
and control civilians with demonic spells.

431
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,460
He gathered ten thousand puppets

432
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,460
and has a demonic woman cultivator with him.

433
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,500
According to the chamberlains of Sheng palace,

434
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,330
it was this woman who advised King Sheng

435
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,500
to hold rituals with your mother's bones.

436
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,810
I shall

437
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,130
personally

438
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,370
fight this war.

439
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,570
Wise decision!

440
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,980
Wise decision!

441
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,020
Wise decision!

442
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,090
Wise decision!

443
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,940
With the World-overturning Jade's side effects,

444
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,940
my body can't last for too long.

445
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,290
I'm about to forge the immortal essence.

446
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,700
With it, I'll be able to trigger
the lightning punishment.

447
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,020
Hope there's still time.

448
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,570
Your Majesty,

449
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,570
according to the refugees who got out,

450
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,330
thick fog has started to appear a few days ago.

451
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,810
And the people in it

452
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,260
will lose contact with the outside world.

453
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,940
This should be

454
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,810
Tantai Minglang's place of demonic cultivation.

455
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,530
Your Majesty,

456
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,370
there should be a lot of trapped civilians inside.

457
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,460
I've sent men go probe in there first.

458
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,810
The troops will pass after safety is confirmed.

459
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,020
What is going on?

460
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,770
What's that?

461
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,420
Let them out now.

462
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,530
Something's not right.

463
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,370
This fog is poisonous.

464
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,500
I'll go rescue them.

465
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,530
The poisonous miasma is too dangerous to go in.

466
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,500
Oh my third brother,

467
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,610
you're so wary.

468
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,810
But the entire southern borders

469
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,530
have been turned into a poisonous fortress.

470
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,610
I guarantee that anyone comes shall not return.

471
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,370
Your abilities to control little animals

472
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,290
won't be of use in here.

473
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,610
Let this place be your

474
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,530
burial ground.

475
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,090
This terrain is quite dangerous.

476
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,290
I'm afraid Tantai Minglang has troops in ambush.

477
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,660
I must first clear the poisonous miasma

478
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,130
to reduce our casualties.

479
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,740
What? What's going on?

480
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,050
What happened?

481
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,980
Look! What's that?

482
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,130
It's the miasma.

483
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,900
It has dispersed!

484
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:26,850
Your Majesty.

485
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,330
Looks like the rumor is true.

486
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,090
His heart and meridians are truly injured.

487
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,810
Let me see

488
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,290
how long your injured heart can last.

489
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,220
Spread my order.

490
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,180
Whoever kills Tantai Jin
shall be a marquis.

491
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,850
Kill Tantai Jin!

492
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,050
We mustn't fight a protracted war.

493
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,740
The southern borders are full of dangers.

494
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,260
We have to keep our morale up

495
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,940
by fighting a quick battle.

496
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:49,940
Baiyu,

497
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,940
follow me closely.

498
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,810
Yes.

499
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,180
Protect His Majesty.

500
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,740
Charge!

501
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,530
Tantai Jin is eager to save his people.

502
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,810
He's forcing out his power.

503
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,740
Let's just let him show off for now.

504
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,090
When his power runs out,

505
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,050
my preparations will about to be finished.

506
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,460
Fu Yu,

507
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,220
I'll go first.

508
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,850
You come later.

509
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,090
Tantai Jin,

510
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,130
let's see how many people you can save.

511
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,420
You'll regret it

512
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,530
after you occupied the poisonous fortress.

513
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,530
Why isn't General Ye at the battle ground?

514
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,570
His Majesty already secured multiple victories.

515
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,850
But you're here wielding your weapon.

516
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,770
Does His Majesty not trust you?

517
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,370
That's not true.

518
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,420
His Majesty told me to guard the capital

519
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,740
in case the rebels launch a sneak attack.

520
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,260
Tantai Minglang is a treacherous one.

521
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,020
His Majesty gives this important mission to me.

522
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,810
It means he trusts me.

523
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,130
Then you're literally sleeping with your weapon.

524
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,220
Well, I'm different.

525
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,180
I just wanna stay in the capital to slack.

526
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,570
Chief Pian Ran, don't you know

527
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,530
if I'm sleeping with my weapon or not?

528
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,370
Ye Qingyu,

529
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,660
you've become good at smooth-talking.

530
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,770
Focus on your practice.

531
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,700
I'll go check at the city gates.

532
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,530
Look at those dark clouds.

533
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,940
How unusual.

534
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,700
There's thunder.

535
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,660
The lightning punishment is coming.

536
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,610
Ye Xiwu, you must hang on.

537
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,090
The sky looks weird.

538
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,610
No, it's not.

539
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,610
This seems like an ominous sign.

540
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,460
Is His Majesty suffering a defeat in the war?

541
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,290
We've only lived a few peaceful days.

542
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,020
Don't tell me...

543
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,660
News of victory!

544
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,460
News of victory!

545
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,370
With His Majesty taking the lead,

546
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,700
our troops smashed into enemy territory.

547
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,740
We will conquer the poisonous fortress soon.

548
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,180
We've captured more than 3,000 rebels

549
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,810
and saved over 10,000 civilians.

550
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,050
Is today some kind of festival?

551
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,210
Why's everybody so excited?

552
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,130
Don't you know it yet?

553
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,020
The rebel Tantai Minglang has been defeated.

554
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,380
Your Highness,

555
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,570
I've found a side door to the old town

556
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,570
at the northwest corner of the Jing capital.

557
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,530
Since it's being retrofitted lately,

558
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,650
few people go through it

559
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,650
and there aren't many guards there.

560
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,650
What's your business?

561
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,170
Material delivery.

562
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,300
Stop for a routine inspection.

563
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,610
You don't look familiar.

564
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,460
Are you carrying any prohibited goods?

565
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,130
Enemy attack!

566
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,460
Tantai Jin,

567
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,090
I didn't expect there's someone

568
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,050
you actually care for in this world.

569
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,860
I'm surprised.

570
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,500
It's the thunder.

571
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,860
I'm about to break through.

572
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
What happened?

573
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,380
Run!

574
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,900
Tantai Jin,

575
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,270
I'm coming.

576
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,670
Your Highness,

577
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,230
the gate to the Jing capital is open.

578
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,940
You'll achieve your ambition very soon.

579
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,380
Well done.

580
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,940
Where do these burglars come from?

581
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,710
How dare you trespass my territory?

582
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,460
A fox spirit wants to guard Tantai Jin's city?

583
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,110
I like eating black-hearted demons the most.

584
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,070
A mixture of human and demon like you

585
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,820
perfectly suits my taste.

586
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,500
Your Highness,

587
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,710
the Ruo Water Puppets are ready.

588
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,940
Mighty Ruo Water, control her soul.

589
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,710
Please enter the palace first.

590
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,230
Leave this fox spirit to me.

591
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,420
Try your best.

592
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,670
Yes.

593
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,550
Go.

594
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,190
Slay our way in!

595
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,980
Attack!

596
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,590
Don't hurt the innocent civilians!

597
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,020
Are you being serious with me?

598
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,060
Demon-hunting Crossbow!

599

Pian Ran, look at me.

605
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,540
I got something to say to you.

606
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,580
I've failed my kingdom and family.

607
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,940
Now I die for protecting the civilians

608
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,220
and protecting my loved one.

609
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,700
This death is worth it.

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,690
What are you talking about?

611
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,900
You won't die.

612
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,570
I won't let you die.

613
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,770
Ye Qingyu.

614
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,460
I thought

615
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,580
I would never be as good as Jiang Rao.

616
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,380
Because he's already dead.

617

He'll live in your heart forever.

I didn't expect that now I'm also...

you're not Jiang Rao.

621
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,500
You don't need to be Jiang Rao.

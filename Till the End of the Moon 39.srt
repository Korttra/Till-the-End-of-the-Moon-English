[Till The End of The Moon]

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,000
[Episode 39]

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,790
The world is in turmoil,
all ages share the same sorrow.

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,920
The world is in turmoil,
all ages share the same sorrow.

20
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,150
[Why did you come back?]

21
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,190
[Interesting.]

22
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,750
[The sweetheart of his bitter life came.]

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,470
Are you here to kill me?

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,430
No.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,360
I am here to listen to you

26
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,870
tell me the reason for doing these things.

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,910
At first you swore to me that

28
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,240
you would not become the Devil God.

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
I believed it without doubt.

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,960
But why have things become like this now?

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Tell me.

32
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,080
[Because I hate you.]

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Five hundred years ago,

34
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,360
I married you,

35
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,710
and I was willing to
share the world with you,

36
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,840
but you betrayed me on the wedding day

37
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,080
and wanted to kill me.

38
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,000
Later,

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,960
I searched for you
in the Nether River for 500 years.

40
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,150
Day after day,
my body was eroded beyond recognition

41
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,360
and I felt pain all over my body.

42
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,470
As for you,

43
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,280
you became an immortal

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,430
in the Heaven Lake on Mount Changze,

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,590
indifferent to the affairs of the world.

46
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,590
In the end,

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,960
you just said lightly that

48
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,430
you deceived me,

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,190
concealed from me,
hurt me and tried to kill me,

50
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,190
all for the sake
of the people of the world.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,150
Do you think
I can forgive you just like that?

52
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,240
Do you think this is fair?

53
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,830
Didn't you say

54
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,360
you wanted to reverse destiny

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,510
and prevent the Devil God
from destroying the three realms?

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Look at all this now,

57
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,800
these are all your retributions,

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,870
as well as Ye Xiwu's.

59
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,390
You once said that

60
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,920
I was born as the Devil God.

61
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,560
In my heart,

62
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,750
hatred is always deeper than love.

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,830
Tantai Jin,

64
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,720
you are lying.

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,000
Li Susu,

66
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,920
stop acting smart.

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
[Kill her!]

68
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,480
[Kill her!]

69
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,870
[And then you can end this damned destiny.]

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,070
[Kill her!]

71
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,000
[And then you can truly become me!]

72
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,830
[Tantai Jin, go ahead!]

73
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,480
[The Devil God…]

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,310
[My hand!]

75
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,470
She is the daughter
of Di Mian and Chu Huang,

76
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,870
A stupid woman and a traitor

77
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,700
wouldn't make a good breed.

78
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,380
Tantai Jin,

79
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,580
she used the Mirror of the Past
to come to your side

80
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,820
in order to kill you.

81
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,180
She's here to save me.

82
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,550
You are already the Devil God,

83
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,380
and why do you need salvation?

84
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,430
Kill her!

85
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,470
Kill her

86
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,110
and you won't feel any pain anymore.

87
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,060
[Kill her! Do it!]

88
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,140
[What are you hesitating about?]

89
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,060
[Kill her!]

90
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,500
She's about to die,

91
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,470
but you are still trapped here by me,

92
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,470
not able to do anything.

93
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,910
Tantai Jin,

94
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,310
since your birth,

95
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,940
anyone who had anything to do with you

96
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,350
all became unfortunate.

97
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,180
What were their names again?

98
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,990
I don't quite remember.

99
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,430
The Yiyue woman that gave birth to you,

100
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,780
your father that hated your guts,

101
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,590
the lowly maids that served you,

102
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,140
and your friend.

103
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Of course,

104
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,710
there was also that grey-haired old man

105
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,870
who taught you boring stuff.

106
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,750
I think he was the most interesting.

107
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,590
Do you know what's so interesting about him?

108
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,540
I think his donkey was the most interesting,

109
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,710
and I really wanted to ride it.

110
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,620
They were all tiny ants.

111
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,990
How could they compare with me

112
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,420
and be worthy of your high regard?

113
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,110
Their misfortune was destined.

114
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,990
The world never really loved you.

115
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,660
Only suffering and misfortune

116
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,140
are your eternal destination.

117
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,540
Come here, Tantai Jin.

118
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,070
Come to me,

119
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,780
and then you can rule everything.

120
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,070
No.

121
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,710
Susu,

122
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,950
wait for me for a little longer.

123
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,420
You are wrong.

124
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,990
My mother was beautiful and kind,

125
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,780
but unfortunately she was chosen by you

126
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,470
and gave birth to the devil fetus.

127
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,620
But she loved me selflessly,

128
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,230
even more than her own life.

129
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
My father

130
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,500
gave me flesh and blood.

131
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,500
Although he had abused me

132
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,870
because of my mother's death,

133
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,710
I still believe that

134
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,870
when I was in my mother's womb,

135
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,470
he must have sincerely
looked forward to my birth.

136
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,420
All his life,

137
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,750
he deeply loved my mother.

138
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,110
Jin Lan'an and Yingxin

139
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,140
did their best to protect me

140
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,870
and take care of me growing up

141
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,710
under the most difficult circumstances.

142
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,140
Xiao Lin

143
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,830
was my enemy in political affairs,

144
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,140
but as a friend

145
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,140
he never let me down.

146
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,590
I had always owed him.

147
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,190
My master

148
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,750
Immortal Zhaoyou

149
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,750
saved me in Ruo Water.

150
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,070
Knowing my unfortunate background,

151
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,470
he still taught me day and night,

152
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,870
giving me rebirth.

153
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,070
Needless to say,

154
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,380
Susu risked her life to save me

155
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,260
and pull me out of hell.

156
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,590
It was she who taught me how to love

157
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,350
and feel all the emotions.

158
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,540
It was she

159
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,380
who broke through the darkness
again and again

160
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,540
and helped me to see the light.

161
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,660
You see,

162
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,260
although I did not receive much love,

163
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,590
I did not receive none.

164
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,710
The only one who pities himself,

165
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,710
resents himself

166
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,500
and wants to destroy everything

167
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,990
had always been you.

168
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,020
Tantai Jin,

169
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,830
you are so ridiculous.

170
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,350
You have already ascended to the top,

171
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,020
yet you are still lingering

Never mind.

338
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,820
The wedding is near.

339
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,540
From now on,

340
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,500
you will no longer have your freedom.

341
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,230
Before this,

342
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,990
is there anywhere that you want to go?

343
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,820
Let me think.

344
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,630
Is it this place?

345
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,430
Why do you bring me to the Mohe River?

346
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,540
No reason.

347
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,100
We are here

348
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,060
when I think of here.

349
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,500
Sit with me for a minute.

350
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,750
Do you still remember Sang Jiu and Ming Ye?

351
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,470
I've been thinking lately.

352
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,390
The war of gods and demons were so grand.

353
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,950
Compared with it,

354
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,750
the love between the two of them

355
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,580
was so tiny.

356
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,300
If not for the Bo're Life,

357
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,340
I'm afraid no one in the coming generations

358
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,150
would remember this forgotten memory.

359
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,390
Such heart-wrenching love

360
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,300
perished so easily in the sands of time.

361
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,780
This shows

362
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,470
how insignificant

363
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,670
and ridiculous

364
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,820
love is.

365
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,750
But,

366
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,710
I'm different from Ming Ye.

367
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,150
I'll be on the highest peak soon.

368
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,300
You have to

369
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,470
stay by my side.

370
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,230
Stop using fancy words on yourself.

371
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,190
Ming Ye is a legitimate God of War
in the Shangqing Realm.

372
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,260
Although he did fail Sang Jiu,

373
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,390
he countered the ancient Devil God.

374
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,580
He did enough for the world

375
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,430
and for everyone in it.

376
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,950
Compared with him,

377
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,860
you're too greedy

378
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,340
and indifferent to others' lives.

379
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,780
A person like you

380
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,060
doesn't get to comment on their love at all.

381
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,670
Never mind.

382
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,230
Now that we're here,

383
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,860
I'll take you to see another thing.

384
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,020
This is…

385
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,020
Ye Mansion from capital of Sheng.

386
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,060
That's right.

387
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,860
It's been 500 years.

388
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,630
Now in the ruins of the capital of Sheng,

389
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,710
this mansion doesn't exist since long ago.

390
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,710
You can take it as my Bo're Life.

391
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,340
A barrier created by me.

392
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,470
A place that doesn't exist.

393
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,860
Tantai Jin,

394
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,260
if you really have nothing to hold dear

395
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,260
and decided to be the Devil God,

396
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,580
then why do you…

397
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,340
I just think it's interesting.

398
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,060
Look.

399
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,190
The Mohe River flows on and on.

400
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,500
It seems to be changing all the time.

401
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,670
But it seems to have never changed, too.

402
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,260
I'm thinking,

403
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,340
when love perishes,

404
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,340
hatred perishes,

405
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,230
and our physical bodies perish,

406
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,910
how can we prove that these emotions

407
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,580
really existed once?

408
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,150
Will the story between us

409
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,750
be known by posterity?

410
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,020
You're already the invincible Devil God,

411
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,820
why fear perishing anyway?

412
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,340
Of course I don't.

413
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,990
I'm just curious.

414
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,230
If others become you and me in the Bo're Life,

415
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,060
how would they feel?

416
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,260
For Ye Xiwu and Tantai Jin

417
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,300
from 500 years ago

418
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,150
the Devil God and Li Susu

419
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,590
have already become your so-called others.

420
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,260
Really?

421
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,030
Seems to make sense.

422
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,260
Come on.

423
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,550
Go watch with me.

424
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,630
Miss, there you are!

425
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,780
I've been looking for you.

426
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,550
Chuntao,

427
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,420
I…

428
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,150
Miss,

429
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,630
you're wearing so little on such a cold day.

430
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,510
If grandma knows about it,

431
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,070
she'll definitely scold me.

432
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,230
-Take this thermal jug to warm your hand.
-Sister!

433
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,380
Sister!

434
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,070
Brother, where are you going like this?

435
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,670
I'm gonna go hunting with Cui Shisan and others.

436
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,190
If dad asks about me,

437
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,260
tell him I went to school.

438
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
The rabbit fur is the softest in this season.

439
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,110
I'll make fur gloves for you and grandma.

440
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,110
They're gonna be super warm.

441
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,860
Go ahead. Be careful.

442
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,590
Got it!

443
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,460
[Dad.]

444
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,940
[Qingyu.]

445
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,750
Great spear moves!

446
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,670
Of course. You're still too young.

447
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,030
When you can undertake a military task alone…

448
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,670
Sister.

449
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,110
Buttercup.

450
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,750
Dad.

451
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,550
Why aren't you home until now?

452
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,070
Grandma…

453
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,750
Grandma's been waiting for you.

454
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,460
Nobody's words worked on her.

455
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,900
She won't eat without you.

456
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Do you know how many times we warmed the dishes?

457
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,750
Look at you.

458
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,230
Buttercup!

459
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,070
Buttercup!

460
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,710
Grandma.

461
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,340
Look at you.

462
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,030
You didn't eat your meals properly.

463
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,110
And you're still wearing so little.

464
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,340
It's gonna snow outside,

465
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,750
but you're still running around out there.

466
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,300
Grandson-in-law, you're to blame, too.

467
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,710
He can't just let you do whatever do like.

468
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,340
You've been like this all year round.

469
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Yes, Grandma.

470
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,230
I'll definitely take good care of Xiwu.

471
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,860
That's more like it.

472
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,670
This is my most precious daughter.

473
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,710
She's been my everything since little.

474
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,070
You gotta take good care of her.

475
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,750
Don't let her suffer a tiny bit at all.

476
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,630
Understood.

477
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,630
General Ye,

478
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,510
after I marry Xiwu,

479
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,780
I'll definitely see her as my precious

480
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,380
and I will never let her feel wronged.

481
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,750
That's what I'm talking about.

482
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,630
No, I'm just…

483
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,860
Knock it off.

484
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,980
Stop scaring him like this all day long.

485
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,190
No, I'm just teasing him.

486
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,030
You…

487
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,150
Come on.

488
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,070
You two, come inside and have dinner.

489
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,550
Come on.

490
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,260
Come.

491
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,820
Let's go.

492
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,420
Come on. Let's eat.

493
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,110
What exactly are you up to?

494
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,710
In this Ye Mansion,

495
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,590
there's no evil bone

496
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,550
nor Devil God.

497
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,900
I'm just your husband.

498
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,340
How do you like it?

499
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,820
This is the Bo're Life in your mind?

500
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,510
What?

501
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,510
You don't like it?

502
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,980
You're the Devil God,

503
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,900
but why would you like this happy mortal life?

504
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,940
You're not me.

505
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,380
How do you know what life the Devil God likes?

506
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,630
These are the poor quality firecrackers

507
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,940
from the new year's eve of that year.

508
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,380
You know what?

509
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,980
I made a wish to the fireworks,

510
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,260
hoping that you wouldn't be the Devil God.

511
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,030
But now I regret loving you.

512
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,070
I even regret wasting that sketch.

513
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
That sketch?

514
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,940
It's worth wasting one for the new year.

515
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,340
I was being naive.

516
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,940
I actually believed a stone-like person

517
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,780
will grow a heart.

518
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,070
It's just a sketch.

519
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,860
With the power I have now,

520
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,710
I can show you any wonderful scenery

521
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,820
in this world.

522
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,940
Ye Xiwu.

523
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,780
Are you this happy on every new year's eve?

524
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,190
This year is a bit different.

525
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,670
But I'm still happy.

526
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,510
Don't worry. With me by your side,

527
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,300
nobody's gonna bully you again.

528
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
We can be happy like this every year.

529
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,510
Li Susu,

530
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,860
it was clearly me

531
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,380
who was lied to.

532
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,710
When you taught me to draw the sketch,

533
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,190
you knew it clearly.

534
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,380
My words count.

535
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,630
I'm here to do what I promised you of course.

536
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,820
What should I teach you?

537
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,940
The type that can repel crows

538
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,300
like you used at Xiao Lin's mansion.

539
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,230
Not that one.

540
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,590
You're an amateur.

541
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,300
What if you blow up the house

542
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,590
when you accidentally draw it wrong?

543
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,380
Whatever the case,

544
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,860
I won't be able to draw it,

545
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,030
right?

546
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,260
What the sketch sees

547
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,190
is the purest and most beautiful things.

548
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,420
Your body, heart and will are the three keys.

549
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,190
When the three unite, your cultivation is good.

550
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,260
Keep your heart humble,

551

keep your body quiet,

552
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,980
and keep your will steady.
This is how you unite them.

553
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,460
You can only make it

554
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,110
when you're free of evil intentions.

because of my fault.

25
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,630
I bear deep hatred

26
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,630
and demand blood for blood.

27
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,080
I'm willing to fall to a devil

Why are you so upset?

Maid Qingniao in Xuanzhang Palace

42
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,070
was dismissed days ago

43
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,310
and left Shangqing Realm.

44
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,070
So you got lovesickness.

45
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,870
But I heard

46
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,630
many maids in several palaces

47
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,430
have been replaced
by the maids from Flying Serpent Tribe.

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,480
I heard Goddess Tian Huan did it.

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,600
After the gods fell,

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,870
I'm afraid Shangqing Realm

51
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,630
is no longer the same as in the past.

52
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,160
It's you again, little imp.

53
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,000
My honored guest,

54
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,430
you're welcome here.

55
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,560
Where's Tian Huan?

56
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
Follow me.

57
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,830
Goddess, have mercy on us.

58
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,190
We had cultivated ourselves

59
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,560
for thousands of years

60
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,870
before getting into Shangqing Realm.

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,630
Please don't drive us away.

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,830
I know it's hard for you
to get into the Realm.

63
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,560
But you can't blame me for this.

64
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,040
Just blame Sang Jiu.

65
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,190
What does it do with Lady Jiu?

66
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,680
Because you served her before,

67
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,160
I feel annoyed

68
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,390
when seeing you.

69
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,000
So,

70
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,560
is that a good reason?

71
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
What if I don't leave?

72
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
What?

73
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,070
I came to Yuqing Palace with God Ming Ye.

74
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,390
God Ming Ye

75
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,750
is also the master of Yuqing Palace.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,480
If you want to drive me away,

77
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
we should argue this with his presence.

78
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,040
Are you threatening me with Ming Ye?

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
When the twelve gods were on the thrones,

80
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,120
no one

81
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,750

82
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,040
or bullying in Shangqing Realm.

83
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,750
Everything should have impartiality.

84
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,240
How dare you offend me!

85
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,750

Goddess,

88
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,240
Sang Jiu from the Mohe River
asks to see you

89
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,240
and says she wants to apologize.

90
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,480
She's putting her head

91
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,560
in the noose before I take action.

92
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
Sang Jiu,

93
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,000
don't you think it's too late

94

95
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,160
No.

Today, you'll be killed

105

[A devil?]

114

and went to the southeastern spring.

115

Ming Ye.

119
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,320
You finally came to save me.

120
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,720
She took away my divine essence.

If you can hear me,

124
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
just put down Tian Huan's divine essence.

125

Come here.

126
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,320

Has the Water Tribe
in the Mohe River been massacred?

146

Although being compelled,

147
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,600
you're generals from Shangqing Realm,

148
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,080
who should never be

Lord Immortal.

151

We were wrong.

152
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,750
We were deceived by Tian Huan.

153
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,790
Since we returned from the Mohe River,

154

we have been feeling guilty.

Lord Immortal,

156
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,910
for the sake of our contribution
to the Realm,

157
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,720
please let us off lightly.

158
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,440
Please spare us.

159
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,960
All of you

160
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,080
will be sent to jail
and be deprived of cultivation.

161
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,440
Wait for your sentences.

162
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,750

163
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,720
Take them away.

164
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,270
Yes.

165

Medicine King,

166
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,150
What's the cure

167
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,790
for Sang Jiu's condition?

168
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,630
I can't always tie her up

169
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,670
with Ruo-River rope.

170
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,750
Her degeneration
is due to her emotional turmoil

171
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,200
and unstable cultivation mind.

172
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,080
Being tormented by the ruination

173
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,240
of the Water Tribe,

174
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,750
Lady Jiu degenerated into a devil.

175
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,750
Mental illness can't be cured by medicine.

176
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,670
Mental illness?

177
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,440
It's not easy.

178
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,390
I'll go see her.

179
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,630
Wait.

180
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,750
Lord Immortal, if you show up now,

181
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,790
I'm afraid you'll remind her
of the painful memories,

182
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,790
and she'll sink deeper.

183
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,790
You'd better leave her alone,

184
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,510
letting the clear energy

185
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,000
dispel some of her devil energy.

186
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,840
You should give her some decoction
to resolve turbidity

187
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,240
and don't see her

188
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,670
until she cools down.

189
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,840
Lord Immortal.

190
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,550
Though this happened because of Tian Huan,

191
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,750
it's a fact that Sang Jiu became a devil,

192
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,550
broke into our gate,

193
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,150
and killed our soldiers.

194
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,600
Shangqing Realm has laws.

195
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,440
Lord Immortal,
you can't be partial to her.

196
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,150
That's right, Lord Immortal.

197
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,270
Shangqing Realm

198
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,840
has been irreconcilable with devils.

199
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,440
Otherwise, the sacrifice
of the Goddess of Space and others

200
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,600
would mean nothing.

201
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,960
Sang Jiu,

202
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,400
have you thought about this?

203
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,350
Ming Ye has been at odds with devils
for many years.

204
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,920
Many of his fellows

205
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,680
were killed by devils.

206
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,880
Since you've become a devil,

207
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,030
how could he tolerate you?

208
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,070
She was right.

209
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,920
There's no turning back for me.

210
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,160
Lord Immortal,

211
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,790
Goddess Tian Huan woke up.

212
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,000
She had lost her divine essence

213
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,030
and had been long soaked in the Ruo River.

214
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
She's now bawling.

215
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,790
Has she confessed?

216
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,440
Yes.

217
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,030
This is her statement.

218
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,110
She has a request.

219
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,590
She said her sin was heavy,

220
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,590
but

221
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,590
she wanted to see you anyway.

222
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,310
You tell Tian Huan.

223
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,790
She took the wrong path

224
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,880
and acted like a devil.

225
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,000
No.

226
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,640
She's eviler than a devil,

227
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,160
so we have nothing to talk about.

228
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,310
When she's punished by the thunderbolt,

229
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,640
and her soul is destructed,

230
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,110
I'll be there to supervise the execution.

231
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,160
How's it?

232
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,440
Goddess, don't worry.

233
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,920
I've notified the elders

234
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,550
of our tribe at your orders.

235
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,480
They'll soon go see God Ming Ye.

236
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,480
You give me such a precious gift.

237
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,750
Elders,

238
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,270
what do you want to exchange it for?

239
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,720
Please spare Tian Huan's life.

240
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,510
This crystal can help
Lady Jiu's clansmen come back to life.

241
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,790
Although Tian Huan made a huge mistake,

242
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,270
she's the Goddess of our tribe.

243
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,000
For the sake of the contribution
of the Flying Serpent Tribe,

244
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,550
please spare her life
and reshape her divine essence

245
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,880
before driving her away
from ShangQing Realm.

246
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,350
We promise

247
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,750
we'll put her

248
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,310
under house arrest

249
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
and forbid her

250
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,680
to step out of Mist Mountain forever.

251
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,880
I can spare her life.

252
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,110
But I won't reshape her divine essence

253
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,920
and release her.

254
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,030
It's too greedy of you.

255
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,550
God Ming Ye

256
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,960
insists on
not reshaping your divine essence

257
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,310
or releasing you.

258
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,920
Our elders have tried our best.

259
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,550
At least we saved your life.

260
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,750
Saved my life?

261
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,110
I lost my divine essence

262
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,920
and have been trapped in the hellhole.

263
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,550
How much longer can I live?

264
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,400
Even if I wouldn't suffer thunderbolt,

265
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm waiting here for death.

266
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,270
Ming Ye,

267
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,790
how cruel you are.

268
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,880
It's ridiculous.

269
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,110
My father has been his benefactor,

270
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,720
and I love him deeply,

271
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,030
but he repaid me with this.

272
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,750
Ming Ye,

273
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,200
if you don't want to save me,

274
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,310
don't think you can save the clam demon.

275
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,070
Yanghe.

276
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,720
Come closer.

277
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,350
Tell the elders

278
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,920
to throw it into Barren Abyss

279
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,720
before telling the news to Sang Jiu.

280
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,030
Lord Immortal.

281
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,000
Has the Flying Serpent gone back?

282
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,640
Yes.

283
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,070
They have left Shangqing Realm.

284
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,550
How did they know

285
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,880
I've purified Bone-refining Seal,

286
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,070
which can reshape divine essence?

287
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,070
Maybe they've heard some rumors.

288
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,960
Keep an eye on Mist Mountain

289
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,400
and let me know the whereabouts

290
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,440
of those elders.

291
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,640
Yes.

292
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,400
Lord Immortal,

293
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,590
you just purified Bone-refining Seal
with the Quadripod,

294
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,240
which cost much of your energy.

295
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,310
And now you're refining
the ten-millennia crystal.

296
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm worried about you.

297
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,240
I know how to take care of my body.

298
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,960
Don't be wordy.

299
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,880
[If I turn this crystal
into a spirit container]

300
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,960
[and put the Water Tribe's shells]

301
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,000
[into it.]

302
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,750
[After one thousand years of cultivation,]

303
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,590
[the Water Tribe will come back to life,]

304
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,110
[which will be a comfort to Sang Jiu]

305
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,240
[and bring her back to the right path.]

306
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,830
Have you heard of it?

307
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,110
God Ming Ye has absolved
Goddess Tian Huan.

308
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,830
Flying Serpent Tribe has a long history.

309
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,960
Through generations,

310
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,160
many heroes like Tian Hao
came from the tribe.

311
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,790
At least God Ming Ye
would show some mercy.

312
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,200
That's right.

313
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,030
I think so.

314
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,590
But the poor Water Tribe was killed.

315
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,680
I heard only Sang You survived

316
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,790
with a serious injury.

317
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,790
He was then thrown into Barren Abyss

318
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,400
and was as good as dead.

319
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,510
[Sang You.]

320
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,680
Sang You.

321
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,000
Sang You.

322
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,240
Sang You.

323
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,510
Sang You.

324
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,240
Sang Jiu.

325
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
God Ji Ze.

326
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,110
Is that you?

327
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,920
Yes.

328
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,160
You shouldn't have come here.

329
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,000
You're a demon.

330
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,920
Don't step forward,

331
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,680
or you'll be doomed eternally.

332
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,790
Sang Jiu,

333
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,350
leave now.

334
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,400
I won't go

335
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,030
until I find Sang You.

336
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,590
Sang Jiu,

337
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,270
don't be stubborn.

338
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,270
The abyss is full of devils.

339
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,830
You won't make it.

340
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,830
Where's Ming Ye?

341
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,030
Why did he let you come alone?

342
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,880
Now, I have the crystal.

343
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,750
Next,

344
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,830
all I need to do is find all the skeletons
of the Water Tribe.

345
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,480
Lord Immortal.

346
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,240
Our soldier reported

347
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
the masters of the Vine Snake Tribe

348
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,830
tended to be suspicious.

349
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,960
They had contact

350
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,510
with the servants
of Yuqing Palace in secret.

351
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,830
Lord Immortal.

352
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Bad news!

353
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,070
Lady Jiu is gone.

354
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,000
A soldier was killed in the palace.

355
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,720
Lord Immortal.

356
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,550
[Sang You, I was being a fool.]

357
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,590
[I should have listened to you.]

358
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,680
[Please be alive.]

359
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:34,960
[This is…]

360
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,680
Sang You.

361
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,750
Sang You.

362
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,720
Sang You.

363
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,440
It's great that you're alive.

364
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,200
Sorry that I'm late.

365
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,310
I'll take you away.

366
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,550
I was wondering who you are,

367
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,200
you two little clam demons.

368
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,310
Having been trapped for so long,

369
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,550
I'm starving.

370
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,550
You're our full meal.

371
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,680
Get away.

372
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,790
Don't be arrogant, little clam.

373
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
Neither of you will leave here alive.

374
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,510
Guys,

375
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,880
take her.

376
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,030
Aren't you God Ming Ye?

377
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,790
You're at odds with us.

378
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,720
Why did you degrade yourself to come here?

379
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,260
The God of War, are you risking your life

380
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,920
for the little clam, your beloved one?

381
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,400
Unfortunately, you came too late.

382
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,960
She's now a mass of bleeding flesh.

383
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,400
All my men, take him.

384
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,640
[Why?]

385
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,240
[Why should we be bullied?]

386
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,070
[Tian Huan has done so many sins]

387
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,640
[but has been forgiven.]

388
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,830
[My clansmen had done nothing bad]

389
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,750
[but had to suffer.]

390
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,790
[Sang Jiu.]

391
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,790
Sang Jiu.

392
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,070
Wake up.

393
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,790
Stop degenerating.

394
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,830
Degenerating?

395
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,510
If you so-called noble and pure gods
and goddesses

396
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,680
do something evil,
that'll be degeneration,

397
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,160
won't it?

398
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,750
Sang Jiu,

399
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,270
go home with me.

400
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,240
I will make up for all the mistakes

401
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,000
that I made in the past.

402
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,960
Go home?

403
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,790
Where is my home?

404
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,510
Tell me where it is!

405
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,440
[She's being very emotional now.]

406
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,640
[Whatever I say,]

407
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,750
[she won't listen to me.]

408
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,590
[I should calm her down first]

409
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,200
[and stop her degenerating.]

410
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,880
Sang Jiu.

411
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,310
Ming Ye, tell me

412
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
if the soldiers who massacred
the Water Tribe

413
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,960
are your troops.

414
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,240
How will you punish them?

415
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,880
Kill them?

416
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,880
They're deceived by Tian Huan

417
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,720
owing to my weak discipline.

418
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,680
I'll give them a severe penalty.

419
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,680
Good.

420
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,680
Have you forgiven Tian Huan

421
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,400
and spared her life?

422
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,030
[God Ming Ye, please spare Tian Huan.]

423
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,280
[Our tribe would give the crystal bowl]

424
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,230
[to help regenerate Lady Jiu's tribe.]

425
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,510
Yes.

426
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,710
But Tian Huan lost her divine essence.

427
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,510
Even if I don't kill her,

428
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,030
she doesn't have many years to live.

429
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,840
Ming Ye, you're so kind.

430
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,630
If you spare their lives,

431
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,150
who should pay for the deaths of my father

432
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,480
and my clansmen?

433
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,760
Do you know what I want?

434
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,840
I want them all to die.

435
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,360
When they raised their swords

436
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,550
to kill children and the old
by the Mohe River,

437
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,710
they had no kindness or sympathy at all.

438
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,670
I'll make them

439
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,630
pay for their cruelty

440
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
and indifference!

441
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,710
Sang Jiu,

442
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
I understand your pain.

443
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,280
But I can't see you become a demon.

444
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,480
You're burying yourself with them.

445
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,630
It's not worth it.

446
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,630
Who are you?

447
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,960
Who do you think you are,

448
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,480
telling me what's worthwhile
and what's not?

449
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,670
Piss off!

450
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,920
Get away!

451
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,320
You…

452
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,590
Sang Jiu.

453
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,360
[I need to figure out
how to take them away first.]

454
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,480
Sang Jiu.

455
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,480
Ming Ye, it has been a long time.

456
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,670
Ji Ze.

457
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,760
Ji Ze.

458
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,960
Why are you in Barren Abyss?

459
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,110
I thought you were…

460
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,670
Yes.

461
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,150
My body has been destroyed,

462
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,590
but my spirit still exists.

463
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,070
I decide to be imprisoned
and guard Barren Abyss

464
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,110
with my divine body.

465
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,880
I can't move in the formation's center,

466
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,670
but I may help you to leave.

467
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,760
It's perilous in Barren Abyss.

468
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
Be sure not to come here again.

469
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,960
Ji Ze.

470
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,510
Ji Ze, wait.

471
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,710
Goddess, forgive us.

472
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,630
We arrived late.

473
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,110
Without God Ming Ye being here,

474
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,630
it's much easier to enter

475
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,480
into the barrier.

476
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,360
Since he took a risk to enter Barren Abyss
to save his girl,

477
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,800
why don't we

478
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,510
get Yuqing Palace back?

479
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
Why did you bring me here?

480
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,840
I thought you would bring me back

481
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,320
to Shangqing Realm and imprison me.

482
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,960
You know, I killed someone.

483
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,110
I promised you

484
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,880
I'd stand by your side.

485
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,920
It's not a lie.

486
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,880
Whether you'll be an immortal or a demon,

487
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,150
you're always my Sang Jiu.

488
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,070
Where's my brother?

489
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,070
I've tried my best.

490
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,030
But he's severely injured

491
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,000
and can't recover fully now.

492
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,840
Don't worry.

493
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,440
As long as we cultivate your clansmen
using the crystal bowl,

494
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,510
they will have the chance to regenerate.

495
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,710
Sang You.

496
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,920
Put the remains of the Water Tribe

497
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,440
into the bowl,

498
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,400
and your clansmen will be back

499
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,440
after 1,000 years.

500
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,190
[The divine power in this bowl
is Ming Ye's…]

501
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,590
Sang Jiu,

502
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,710
since you just became a demon,
you're salvageable.

503
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,320
I've refined Bone-refining Seal

504
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,960
and will help you
reshape your divine essence with it.

505
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,710
I've asked Medicine King.

506
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,800
He said if you kept a cultivation mind,

507
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,550
with time,

508
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,550
you could get away from the demonic path

509
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,840
and back to the immortal path.

510
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,590
Sang Jiu, I really enjoyed the life

511
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,000
that I spent with you here.

512
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,440
[For the rest of my life,]

513
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,510
[All I want is to live such a life,]

514
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,320
whatever the cost.

515
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,480
Could you…?

516
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,800
Could you trust me once again?

517
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,280
How did you get

518
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,000
the ten-millennium crystal?

519
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,710
From the Vine Snake Tribe.

520
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,440
Sang Jiu, listen to me.

521
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,840
They said they would
give me the crystal bowl

522
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,480
if I spared Tian Huan's life.

523
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,550
I agreed.

524
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,110
I know you bear deep hatred.

525
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,440
But only with the crystal bowl

526
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,230
can you bring your clansmen back to life.

527
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,280
You care about the lives

528
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,440
of your clansmen
more than that of Tian Huan,

529
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,110
right?

530
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,480
Ming Ye,

531
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,320
you're impartial and lead by example.

532
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,440
You're an excellent god.

533
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,230
But you must understand

534
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,110
this is not a transaction.

535
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,960
Not everything in this world

536
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,320
can be measured fairly

537
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,110
or exchanged equally.

538
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,030
Ming Ye, do you still remember

539
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,760
the story my father

540
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,800
told me?

541
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,840
It's about the king who cut off his flesh

542
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,710
to save the dove.

543
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,230
He chose to do that

544
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,110
just out of his compassion.

545
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,960
The white dove looked so cute.

546
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,070
Anyone would have compassion for it.

547
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,710
As for me,

548
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,630
I had a crush on you

549
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,190
and fell in love with you.

550
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,400
Even if I knew I had to pay for it,

551
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,840
I still took the knife.

552
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,550
I thought

553
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,400
I had enough courage to bear the cost.

554
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,110
But I never expected

555
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,960
such a huge cost.

556
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,360
It's too huge.

557
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
The king lost all his flesh

558
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,840
because of his kindness.

559
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,440
And I caused the extinction

560
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,800
of the Water Tribe because of you.

561
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,880
How ridiculous I am.

562
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,280
How sinful I am.

563
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,030
I'm only a clam demon,

564
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,110
not as devout as the king.

565
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,360
He didn't regret it,
so he became immortal.

566
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,630
But I can't.

567
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,880
I regret it.

568
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,710
I'm so regretful
that I want to kill myself.

569
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,070
Since the day Tian Huan slaughtered

570
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,320
my tribe by the Mohe River,

571
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,880
my heart

572
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,550
has been filled
with redemption and revenge.

573
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,280
There's no place for you.

574
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,030
No.

575
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,480
Sang Jiu.

576
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,510
I'll find a way

577
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,630
to save my brother.

578
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,190
I don't want to owe you

579
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,590
a debt.

580
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,510
I'll kill

581
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,320
my foe on my own.

582
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,590
Tian Huan,

583
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,480
Vine Snake Tribe produced many heroes.

584
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,880
How could you enter into collusion

585
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,760
and steal the crown?

586
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,230
Yeah.

587
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,630
Our tribe produced many heroes.

588
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,920
As the daughter of Tian Hao,

589
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,510
why can't I be the leader of the realm?

590
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,510
Ridiculous.

591
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,670
You took credit
for your father's contribution

592
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,190
but made no contribution.

593
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,590
How can you be the leader?

594
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,710
When we followed God Ming Ye
to fight with demons,

595
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,710
where were you?

596
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,510
We will never bow to you.

597
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,440
When God Ming Ye returns,

598
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,320
your tribe will get what you deserve!

599
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,550
Ming Ye.

600
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,670
He degraded himself

601
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,630
to go to the Barren Abyss

602
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,000
to save a demon.

603
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,510
What qualifies him to condemn me?

604
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,150
Besides, it's not certain whether he'll

605
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,480
get out of there.

606
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
That's it.

607
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,400
You refuse to take me as your leader.

608
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,070
Soldiers,

609
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,960
throw them into the Quadripod
and burn them.

610
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,400
You…

611
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,630
With enough lives in it,

612
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,320
there will be divine essence for me.

613
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,880
It's a good idea

614
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,960
to refine divine essence
with the Quadripod.

615
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,880
I wonder whether I'll extract
something useful

616
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,510
if I put your tribe into the quadripod.

617
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,440
Sang Jiu,

618
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,510
you're actually alive!

619
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,440
She's a demon.

620
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,110
Arrest and kill her.

621
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,150
No.

622
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,480
Don't kill me.

623
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,000
I didn't expect
that a goddess would be afraid to die.

624
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,510
So you're no different from us,

625
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,070
little imps.

626
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,590
Don't think you're nobler.

627
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,070
Sang Jiu.

628
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,360
Do you think you can get

629
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,280
your clansmen back by killing me?

630
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,230
Do you think you and Ming Ye
can be back together?

631
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,880
Dream on you.

632
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,070
You're still in denial.

633
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,550
I admit

634
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,550
you're much luckier than me

635
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,590
because you're going to reunite

636
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,800
with your tribe.

637
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,550
I thought to myself,

638
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,400
and I don't have anything to say to you.

639
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:57,630
Goodbye.

640
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,070
Tian Huan.

641
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:39,320
Here, I take an oath

642
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,630
to the world.

643
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,110
I'll find and kill Vine Snake Tribe

644
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,320
until they've been exterminated.

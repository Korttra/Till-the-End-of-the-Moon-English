General Ye,

21
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,060
what are you doing?

22
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,970
His Majesty went crazy. Are you crazy too?

23
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,570
If my sister sees

24
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,340
what you've become now,

25
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,290
she will only be disgusted.

26
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,420
That's nonsense.

27
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,650
Why would she marry me

28
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,570
if she found me disgusting?

29
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,010
And why would she treat me well?

30
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
In this world,

31
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,420

I plead with you
and with you on her behalf.

37
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,730
Please spare her
and let her rest in peace with dignity.

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,650
What you gave her, she didn't want.

39
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,490
And what she wanted from you,
you always failed to fulfill.

40
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,490
She just wanted to leave you.

41
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,820
She was even willing to die for it.

I don't want to…

52
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,210
I don't want to torture her.

53
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,730
I just want to be nice to her,

General!

83

His Majesty doesn't
have many close confidants.

84
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,420
You are the only one who can advise him.

85
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,020
You cannot leave like this.

86
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,020
My persuasion will be useless

87
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,540
if he is stubbornly
trapped in his own delusions.

88

I also want to mourn

my loved ones as he does.

of someone to revive the country,

96
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,260
but he is indulging in his own sorrow

97
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,370
and is unwilling to wake up.

and Pian Ran all die in vain?

101
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,820
He wants to die with Xiwu,

102
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,930
but what about me?

103
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,650
Why would I want to live miserably alone?

104
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,300
But I cannot let them die in vain.

105
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,740
The broken country and its people

106
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,170
need someone to carry it forward.

107
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,170
Can you understand how I feel?

108
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,210
Yes.

109
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,700
I may never be able to

110
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,450
be as crazy as His Majesty.

111
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,650
This is the consequence

112
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,540
of those who have been
through the horrors of war.

113
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,050
The first thing that comes to my mind

114
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,700
is what to do with those who lived,

115
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,740
and who caused them

116
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,420
to reach this point today.

117
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,260
The culprit, Tantai Minglang,

118
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,100
was killed by His Majesty himself.

119
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,650
General Ye, who are you referring to?

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,490
Chief,

121
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,890
they have found Ye Bingchang.

122
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,420
She wanted to leave the city in disguise

123
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,610
but was recognized by the guards.

124
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,140
Should…

125
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,140
should we lock her back in?

126
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,370
Mr. Nian,

127
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,210
can you bring Ye Bingchang here?

128
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,860
I have questions for her.

129
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,770
Why did you escape?

130
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,610
Qingyu,

131
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,490
save me.

132
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,370
I don't want to be locked up again.

133
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,740
The dungeon is an abyss of darkness.

134
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,140
and I have had enough.

135
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
I also understand that I was wrong.

136
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,770
That day in the dungeon,

137
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,740
why did you try to kill Xiwu?

138
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,650
If we were one moment late,

139
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,050
she would have died there.

140
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
I told you,

141
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,330
I was taking revenge.

142
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,580
Ye Xiwu caused Xiao Lin's death.

143
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,260
Lie!

144
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,980
Ye Bingchang,

145
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,770
Later on, I thought about it
over and over again.

146
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,770
You are her own sister.

147
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,130
If you wanted to kill her,
you had many opportunities to do so.

148
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,980
There was no need to wait
until she was thrown into prison.

149
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,010
Ye Qingyu,

150
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,450
you are indeed the only smart person

151
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,450
in the entire Ye family, except for me.

152
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,740
I am also your sister.

153
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,210
Are you really going to give me no way out

154
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,210
just because of Xiwu?

155
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,010
Don't compare yourself with Xiwu.

156
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,420
What you've been doing
has made you disqualified

157
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,940
from being a member
of the Ye family since long ago.

158
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,650
Is that so, Ye Qingyu?

159
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,010
What right do you have

160
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,620
to criticize me from
a high and mighty position?

161
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,740
Throughout history, the winners
have always been taking it all.

162
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
If Xiao Lin had conquered the world,

163
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,300
it would be Ye Xiwu who kneels here today,

164
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,100
being spurned by you.

165
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,010
Alright,

166
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,650
since you want to know the truth so badly,

167
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,690
I will tell you.

168
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,210
I tried to kill Ye Xiwu

169
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,860
because I didn't want the truth

170
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,540
about the poisoned porridge
to be exposed one day.

171
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,940
Poisoned porridge?

172
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,540
Yes.

173
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,940
Ye Xiwu wanted to please Tantai Jin.

174
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,060
She couldn't cook
but insisted on making porridge.

175
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,740
So I decided to

176
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,060
put some poison in the porridge.

177
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,940
What did you say?

178
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,650
What about Grandma?

179
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,810
You knew the porridge was poisoned,

180
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,890
and yet you still gave it to Grandma!

181
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,890
That's right.

182
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,740
I want her

183
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,810
to die with Tantai Jin

184
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,060
and Ye Xiwu.

185
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,210
Ye Bingchang,

186
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,690
you are out of your mind!

187
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,620
Not at all!

188
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,180
I was very clear-headed.

189
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,300
I just didn't want to
tolerate this anymore.

190
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,380
The old lady sided with Ye Xiwu

191
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,450
and only loved her.

192
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,300
Since she liked Ye Xiwu so much,

193
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,100
I could just fulfill her wish.

194
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,300
Then why did you want to

195
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,380
poison Tantai Jin?

196
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Tantai Jin!

197
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,690
It's all because of him,

198
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,060
that Xiao Lin was nothing.

199
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,770
I lost everything.

200
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,690
Later

201
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,210
he even took away the love threads.

202
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,810
Yet he still wanted me to live,

203
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,770
but I didn't want to yield.

204
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,180
I wouldn't have fallen to this point

205
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,740
if it weren't for him.

206
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,940
I see.

207
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,210
If it weren't for you,

208
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,330
Xiao Lin wouldn't have died.

209
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,100
I thought Ye Xiwu wanted to
kill me for Xiao Lin,

210
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,010
so that was why
everything happened afterward.

211
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,940
Open your mouth.

212
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,810
You wanted to kill me,

213
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,450
but you got Xiao Lin killed.

214
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,450
Since then, Ye Xiwu hated me to the bone,

215
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,810
which led to where we are today.

216
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,890
Nonsense!

217
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,380
It wasn't me!

218
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,210
It was you!

219
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,690
You and Ye Xiwu got Xiao Lin killed!

220
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,250
Ye Bingchang,

221
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,010
Xiao Lin entrusted me

222
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,420
to spare your life before his death,

223
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,770
so what should I do now?

224
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,180
I never liked this world,

225
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,330
but Ye Xiwu is different.

226
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,810
She loved this world.

227
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,330
She wanted to give love

228
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,210
even to widows and orphans,

229
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,380
to refugees and the common people.

230
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,940
That's why I wanted to try

231
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,130
to love this world like she did.

232
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,650
But now that

233
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,810
Ye Xiwu is gone,

234
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,380
my heart is dead too.

235
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,450
I want to hate everything,

236
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,740
but Ye Xiwu wouldn't be happy about it.

237
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,300
Ye Bingchang,

238
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,980
If you like porridge so much,

239
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,180
I'll let you have enough of it.

240
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,450
Yes!

241
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,500
Let me out!

242
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,690
Let me out!

243
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,770
Tantai Jin,

244
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,300
Tantai Jin!

245
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,540
You're awake!

246
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Don't sleep here. You'll catch a cold.

247
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,420
I know what I'm doing.

248
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,650
What are you doing?

249
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,740
Once you start reading memorials,
you never take a break.

250
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,500
Even if you want to become a good king

251
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,570
who works hard for the people,

252
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,650
you cannot harm your own body.

253
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,380
Why are you looking at me like that?

254
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,250
I won't run away all of a sudden.

255
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,330
Ye Xiwu,

256
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,740
what do you really want to do

257
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,690
by coming to my side?

258
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,060
Yes,

259
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,860
I should have left.

260
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:05,980
Ye Xiwu!

261
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,380
Ye Xiwu!

262
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,450
Ye Xiwu!

263
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,740
Ye Xiwu!

264
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,380
Ye Xiwu!

265
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,330
Xiao Lin,

266
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,860
why did you die?

267
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,500
Why don't you come and save me?

268
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,100
The one I wanted to kill was Tantai Jin!

269
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,250
Now you are dead.

270
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,380
What is the use of your dying wish?

271
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,020
Tantai Jin still wants to kill me.

272
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,170
Pang Yizhi?

273
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,570
Ye Bingchang.

274
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,980
Why are you here?

275
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,330
Are you here to save me?

276
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,810
You deserve your punishment,

277
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,810
so I won't save you.

278
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,660
However, Xiao Lin left something with me

279
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,690
before his death

280
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,740
and asked me to find an opportunity
to give it to you.

281
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,780
It's a letter from him.

282
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,530
Wife…

283
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,660
he still recognized me as his wife.

284
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,860
But it's a little late.

285
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Xiao Lin was upright and loyal,

286
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,020
but how did you treat him?

287
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,690
Upright

288
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,170
and loyal…

289
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,260
what does that have to do with me?

290
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,330
That's all I can say.

291
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,380
Bingchang,

292
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,410
things have come to this point.

293
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,290
I no longer care about
the letter you wrote

294
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,620
asking me to save you

295
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,050
or whether you ever plotted against me.

296
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,210
We are a married couple,

297
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,810
and there are some things

298
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,020
I still want you to know.

299
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,530
It is said that the closest people
can sometimes be the least close.

300
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,140
In the past, I was constantly distressed,

301
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,330
feeling that no matter how hard I tried,

302
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,410
I could not win your complete trust.

303
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,020
It was not until the day
I learned about the Love Threads incident

304
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,740
that I finally understood

305
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,530
why you always seemed so uneasy.

306
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,620
You were worried

307
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,980
that the love you received was all false,

308
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,330
weren't you?

309
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,780
Bingchang,

310
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,170
actually, whether you had
that strand of Love Threads or not,

311
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,050
there would still be people loving you.

312
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,290
Perhaps you don't remember this:

313
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,290
In the late spring of that year,

314
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,410
you and the women of the Ye family
went outside the city to worship ancestors,

315
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,860
and you got off the carriage alone
to take a walk.

316
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,380
I still remember how happy you were

317
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,290
because of a cluster of blackberry roses

318
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,780
and how beautiful your smile was.

319
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,380
Blackberry roses do not compete with
other flowers during springtime

320
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,210
and bloom the latest in loneliness.

321
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,780
I will remember your look

322
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,860
with flowers in your hair and your smile
in spring for the rest of my life.

323
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,900
Later on, when you distributed porridge
to the people in the city,

324
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,500
I secretly went to watch as well.

325
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,410
I liked you not because of
that strand of Love Threads,

326
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,170
but because of who you are.

327
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,740
Unfortunately, I never got the chance
to tell you these things,

328
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,930
and our fate has come to an end.

329
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,330
Bingchang,

330
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,020
I hope that your wishes may come true.

it was the love threads
that made me receive favoritism.

Mr. Nian,

351
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,570
thank you for previously taking care

352
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,660
of the burial of my father and brother.

353
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Your father and elder brother

354
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,100
sacrificed to protect the people.

Chief Pian Ran did the same.

are truly admirable.

How is His Majesty?

358
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,740
He went to the royal tomb
early this morning,

359
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,810
and he promised

360
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,690
to bury Xiwu with the ceremony
of a queen in a few days.

361
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,020

363
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,530
Nothing.

364
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,780
I hope he doesn't go back on his words.

365
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,980
The courtiers were initially worried

366
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,450
that His Majesty would
abandon the country for one person,

367

weren't the king anymore,

374
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,170
so that he could

Sir,

435
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,810
we have searched through the ruins,

436
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,780
but found nothing.

437
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,620
His Majesty must have had a plan

438
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,570
and left the letter
in the study in advance.

439
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,690
A country cannot be
without a ruler for even a day.

440
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,500
His Majesty entrusted in the letter,

441
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,530
instructing you to find a capable member

442
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,620
from a branch of the Tantai family

443
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,860
to inherit the throne.

444
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,500
For the stability of the kingdom,

445
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,780
you must complete His Majesty's request.

446
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:44,930
Yes.

447
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,690
Too many people have died.

448
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,930
I can't believe it has been
ten thousand years already.

449
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,570
I never thought that you and I

450
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,100
would have a chance to meet again.

451
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,100
Si Ying?

452
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:00,660
That's right.

453
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,050
We both lived.

454
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,210
But we never get to meet His Lordship.

455
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,570
Don't be sad.

456
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,330
It has been ten thousand years.

457
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,100
It's time

458
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,140
to welcome the new Devil God.

459
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,330
True.

460
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,100
As long as the evil bone remains,

461
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,100
His Lordship will never disappear.

462
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,410
Now that the Barren Abyss Barrier
is unsealed,

463
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,780
from today onwards,

464
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,570
I will travel across
the Four Continents and Three Realms

465
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,530
to find the trail of the new Devil God.

466
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,530
But with such boundless crowds,

467
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,450
where should I start my search?

468
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,660
The bank of Ruo River.

469
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,050
I heard the bank of Ruo River

470
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,900
is where the spirits of the dead gather.

471
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,620
But His Lordship is the Devil God.

472
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,290
Would his spirit be there?

473
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,170
His Lordship certainly would not

474
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,620
mingle with the ordinary.

475
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,570
However, I heard that back then,

476
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,620
His Lordship made a special agreement

477
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,100
with the Yiyue tribe
of the Bank of Ruo River.

478
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,100
Why don't we start our search from there?

479
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,260
Good idea.

480
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,380
Now that we have been revived,

481
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,690
it's time for us to reunite and restore

482
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,980
the Demon Realm for His Lordship.

483
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,450
It's been ten thousand years,

484
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,810
and do you still know us?

485
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,860
I am the Monster of Drought, Si Ying.

486
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,140
Today, under the command of the Devil God,

487
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,660
I order you

488
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,290
to find the Devil God
and restore Barren Abyss.

489
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,050
Those who refuse to obey

490
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,450
shall be killed!

491
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:58,570

492
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:07,620
Devil God!

493
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,050
The Ruo River, guarded by the Yiyue tribe,

494
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,930
is also the Nether River.

495
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,930
When the moon turns into
an underworld moon,

496
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,450
The Yiyue tribe

497
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,500
can use their secret spells
to open the Gate of Underworld Moon

498
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,780
and enter the place
where the spirits gather.

499
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:56,860

500
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,690

505
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,930

506
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,140
Let go!

507
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,100
Your Majesty,

508
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,570
I know that rescuing you

509
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,900
is against your will.

510
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,860
However, I know of a way

511
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,620
for you to see Ye Xiwu again.

512
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,660
Ye Xiwu is right here.

513
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,970
I'm not going anywhere.

514
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,620
Go away!

515
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,380
Your Majesty!

516
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,330
Nian Baiyu!

517
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,900
The Ruo River, guarded by the Yiyue tribe,

518
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,420
is also the Nether River.

519
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,810
I can tell you

520
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,570
where to find Ye Xiwu's spirit.

521
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,530
What did you say?

522
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,530
But, Lord,

523
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,940
are you sure you want to go in?

524
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,860
The Gate of Underworld Moon
has been opened a few times,

525
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,940
but the people who entered

526
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,940
never came back.

527
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,420
Mister,

528
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,010
will you come back?

529
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,220
Lord,

530
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,180
there is no end or way out in there.

531
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,530
How will you come back?

532
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,250
Nian Baiyu,

533
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,570
thank you
for your helping me the whole time.

534
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,530
Ye Xiwu,

535
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,100
where are you?

536
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,460
Ye Xiwu,

537
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
where are you?

538
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,570
Lord…

539
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,250
Here,

540
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,970
freshly boiled milk tea.

541
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,970
Thanks, Sister.

542
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,380
Baiyu,

543
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,660
stop feeling sad.

544
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,330
Every man has his destiny.

545
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,770
You have done everything you can.

546
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,050
Sister, Mom,

547
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,050
do you think the Lord

548
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,140
can find who he wants to meet?

549
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,180
This type of thing

550
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,970
is up to how sincere one's heart is.

551
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,420
Who knows?

552
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,050
There are thousands of spirits in there.

553
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,100
Even if he can resist
the erosion of the Ruo Water,

554
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,290
how long will it take for him

555
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,220
to recognize each spirit one by one?

556
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,420
Ye Xiwu, where are you?

557
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,530
Look. It's him again.

558
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,220
He has been here for several months.

559
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,620
Who is he looking for?

560
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,140
I don't know.

561
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,420
I don't know.

562
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,530
Let's ask him

563
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,460
Who are you looking for?

564
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,290
Ye Xiwu.

565
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,100
I'm looking for her.

566
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,700
Can you help me find Ye Xiwu?

567
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,220
Ye Xiwu?

568
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,300
Is the one you are looking for
called Ye Xiwu?

569
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,420
Yes.

570
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,700
Ye Xiwu.

571
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,540
There are so many spirits here,

572
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,900
and we don't know them all.

573
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,760
But perhaps the one you're looking for

574
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,340
is in the depths of the Nether River.

575
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
However…

576
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Ye Xiwu,

577
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,100
where is she?

578
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,300
Tantai Jin,

579
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,180
you are here.

580
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,440
Ye Xiwu!

581
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,540
Tantai Jin,

582
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
long time no see.

583
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,780
Ye Xiwu,

584
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,620
you are really here!

585
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,940
You finally came.

586
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,340
It's really you!

587
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,960
Ye Xiwu!

588
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,200
Where did you go?

589
00:39:59,310 --> 00:39:59,880
No!

590
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,790
Ye Xiwu!

591
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:08,960
Ye Xiwu!

592
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,100
Ye Xiwu!

593
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,790
Ye Xiwu!

594
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,590
Mortal bodies will be tempted
by the Ruo Water and see illusions,

595
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,830
and in the end, they will be devoured.

596
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,880
Ye Xiwu,

597
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,550
you must be in the Nether River.

598
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,270
I will find you!

599
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,100
Instead of letting you perish,

600
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,100
let us take you to find her.

601
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,270
Get on the boat.

602
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,510
You won't be hurt
as long as you don't touch the water.

you died because of me,

No matter what it takes,

611
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,140

for a deceased person?

629
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,200
Yes.

630
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,880
I will

631
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
keep looking,

632
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,800
and keep doing this,

633
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,740
until my life is over.

634
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,560
Baiyu,

635
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,880
where did you go?

636
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,480
Mom,

637
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,000
I just went to
the Bank of Ruo River to check

638
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,280
if Lord is back or not.

639
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
You know very well that

640
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,240
the Gate of Underworld Moon
only opens once every 500 years.

641
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,880
Your Lord entered it

642
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,040
and there's no way he will be back.

643
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,880
Baiyu,

644
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,000
since you are already back here,

645
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,960
just let go of the past,

646
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,760
and live your life well.

647
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,000
Yes, Baiyu.

648
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,160
The girl I talked to you about last time,

649
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,560
do you really not want to meet her?

650
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,520
Maybe I should really forget about Lord.

651
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,400
Yes,

652
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,160
live your own life.

653
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:46,840
Mom, Sister,

654
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,680
stay home.

655
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,720
I will go and check it out.

656
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,640
Run!

657
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,400
Be careful!

658
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,520
Hurry up!

659
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,920
It's not fun to kill him.

660
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,240
Why don't we just keep him alive,

661
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,680
in case he might
come in handy in the future?

662
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,200
Let's go.

663
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,400
Let's look for the demonic fetus.

664
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,400
I don't know how long it will take

665
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,240
to look through them one by one.

666
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,440
Lord,

667
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,680
I can't live to see you come back.

668
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,440
I found two dandelions

669
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,840
in your precious Royal Garden.

670
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,040
Surprisingly, they have not been removed
by the gardeners.

671
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,400
They are really fortunate.

672
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,720
I heard that you could
make wishes on dandelions,

673
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,280
so I dug them up.

674
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,200
My hands…

675
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,640
Why?

676
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,640
Now I'm taking your evil bone

677
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,560
and paying you back
with the divine essence.

678
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,040
You won't become the Devil God anymore.

679
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,160
Ye Xiwu,

680
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,400
is the divine essence
you gave me healing me?

681
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,600
You let me live,

682
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,080
but also made me suffer

683
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,360
the pain of shredding me in pieces
again and again.

684
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,320
Is this your revenge on me?

685
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,440
It doesn't matter.

686
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,160
As long as it's from you,

687
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,040
I will accept it.

688
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,400
Why are you still not giving up?

689
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:30,920
No…

690
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,080
She is still somewhere in here.

691
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,120
I will definitely find her.

692
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
Who is he?

693
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,920
A pitiful person.

694
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,220
In order to find his deceased lover,

695
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,280
he has been searching
in the Nether River for a hundred years,

696
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,560
but still hasn't found her.

697
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,440
World-overturning Jade…

698
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,960
Can it help me

699
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,480
find Ye Xiwu's spirit?

700
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,640
She bore the curse
of violent death for me.

701
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,480
Please give me a chance to repay her.

702
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,480
Ye Xiwu,

703
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,440
when can I find you?

704
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,280
Today I will tell you a secret story.

705
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,080
It is said that five hundred years ago,

706
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,800
the king was named Tantai Jin.

707
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,200
Legend has it that he was born
by killing his mother,

708
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,320
which was extremely ominous,

709
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,120
but he unified Jing and Sheng

710
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,480
and achieved greatness.

711
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,200
Nobody knows that

712
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,040
he once burned down the Palace of Jing

713
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,760
for a woman,

714
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,400
and was burned so badly
that his face was destroyed.

715
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,080
To commemorate him,

716
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,700
the Tantai family's generations of kings

717
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,220
have all worn masks

718
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,200
Tantai Jin…

719
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,800
to cover their faces.

720
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,160
There is another secret story

721
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,200
that said the Devil God would appear
in the world again

722
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,280
in 500 years, which is now.

723
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,920
There are too many rumors
about the world ending.

724
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,320
Someone also said that
Devil God would end the world last year,

725
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,080
but what happened?

726
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,760
Nothing.

727
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,080
The healing power of divine essence
is getting weaker and weaker.

728
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,040
I'm afraid my body has reached its limit.

729
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:32,920
Ye Xiwu,

730
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,480
even if I were to die today,

731
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,000
I would still search for you
for another day.

732
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,880
After I die,

733
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,720
my spirit can merge
with this Nether Water,

734
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,800
and I will continue to seek you.

735
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,800
Are you still not giving up?

736
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,360
Sir, why are you still not giving up?

737
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,360
Don't waste your breath with him.

738
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,840
After being washed
by the Ruo Water for 500 years,

739
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,440
he can no longer hear anything.

740
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,440
Tantai Jin,

741
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,760
Tantai Jin,

742
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,160
go back with me.

743
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,280
Don't you get too carried away.

744
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,000
I never said I'd spend
the rest of my life with you.

745
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,600
Ye Xiwu,

746
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,440
I'm coming for you.

747
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:05,780

It's really lucky for Prince Tantai

173
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,670
to be able to return unharmed.

174
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,200
If something happened to him

175
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,390
not only the Ye family,
but the whole world

176
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,320
could be in trouble.

177
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,510
Why are you saying so?

178
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,030
Looks like Miss Xiwu

179
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,790
knows little about state affairs.

180
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,670
Tantai Jin is a hostage from Jing Kingdom.

181
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,630
As a Tantai,

182
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
his life is bonded
with the fate of his nation.

183
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,030
If anything happens to him,

184
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,510
it'll give Jing Kingdom
an excuse to attack us.

185
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,840
Sheng has been losing
military talents these years.

186
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,030
It's definitely not a good time for war.

187
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,320
By then, despite His Majesty would punish

188
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,910
the Ye family for dereliction of duty,

189
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,270
once the war breaks out,

190
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,480
all males of Ye family
must go to the frontline,

191
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
which is a disaster for your own family.

192
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,270
Once the fire of war ravaged the field,

193
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,510
causing severe deaths to normal people,

194
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
and will be a catastrophe for everyone.

195
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,150
I'm gonna keep an eye on him.

196
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
So that's how it is.

197
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,480
[Prince Tantai left his homeland]

198
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,030
[to be a guest in our Sheng Kingdom.]

199
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,960
[He did it for the peace of two kingdoms.]

200
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,080
[And also for keeping the civilians
away from the agony of war.]

201
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
[We should treat him politely.]

202
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
[How can you bully him without scruples?]

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,750
Turns out, Xiao Lin cared about me

204
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,480
so that his kingdom can be safe.

205
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,840
Ye Xiwu cares about me

206
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,670
so that her family could be safe.

207
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
In their eyes,

208
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,320
I'm just a jinx who only brings disasters.

209
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,480
Do you mean anything more

210
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,550
when you say, "keep an eye on him"?

211
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,790
Prince Lin,

212
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,390
I don't wanna lie to you.

213
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,150
But I can't explain it to you further.

214
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,000
Honestly,

215
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,390
I hate Tantai Jin

216
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,120
more than anyone else.

217
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,440
[I wanna kill him even in my dreams.]

218
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
[I even wished]

219
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,270
[he never existed in this world.]

220
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,550
But rest assured,

221
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,200
I won't let him die.

222
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,840
But if you want me
to truly care about him,

223
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,840
it's impossible.

224
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,960
Ye Xiwu,

225
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,550
you finally told the truth.

226
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,240
All your performance in front of me

227
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
was just for your own benefit.

228
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,790
Turns out

229
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,720
you're no different from them.

230
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,030
[I actually thought]

231
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,120
[someone would really care about me.]

232
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,670
Father,

233
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,480
the eldest daughter
of General Ye and I have been in love.

234
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
Would you grant my wish

235
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,630
to marry her?

236
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,000
Do you really love her?

237
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,840
For a lifetime.

238
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,390
Lin,

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,510
don't say it too soon.

240
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,600
What exactly do you love about her?

241
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,630
Her looks,

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
or her mind?

243
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,510
Looks will eventually fade away,

244
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,120
and people's minds will also change.

245
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,750
Nothing in this world

246
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,880
can let love last.

247
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,000
Father,

248
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,240
I don't know exactly why I love Bingchang.

249
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,480
Since childhood,

250
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,750
everything I did had a proper reason,

251
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,310
except falling in love with her.

252
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,110
I am following my heart
for no reason at all.

253
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,920
What a surprise.

254
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,350
There's actually someone in this world

255
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,000
who can break you out of your norm.

256
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,070
Alright,

257
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,550
let me think about it.

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Thanks, Father.

259
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,400
Miss.

260
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,110
Miss,

261
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,350
I got some news.

262
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,200
What is it?

263
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,920
There's an edict from the palace

264
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,350
asking Mrs. Ye to see His Majesty.

265
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,240
Miss,

266
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
could it be anything about your marriage?

267
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,590
After Prince Lin went back,

268
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,310
he must have asked His Majesty
to grant marriage to you two.

269
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,270
But Her Ladyship favors Miss Xiwu,

270
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,750
if she says something
in front of His Majesty…

271
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,590
Jiahui, don't say it like that.

272
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,750
Xiwu has already been married.

273
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,240
It's a done deal.

274
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,680
No matter how much Grandma favors her,

275
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,030
there's no reason for her
to stop my marriage.

276
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,270
Miss,

277
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,440
you haven't realized how complex it is.

278
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,750
Think about it,

279
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,030
ever since you were a child,

280
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,550
be it clothes, jewelry,

281
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,790
food or things to enjoy,

282
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,270
when Miss Xiwu gets something,

283
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,400
you don't necessarily have it.

284
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
But if it's something even she can't have,

285
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,480
have you ever had it?

286
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,880
Miss…

287
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,920
[Ye's Residence]
You Great General Ye Xiao's eldest daughter

288
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,880
who's known for her graceful appearance,

289
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
gentle character,

290
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,720
kind heart,

291
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,680
and etiquette-conforming behaviors,

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,070
therefore I grant her the title of
Side Concubine of Prince Xuancheng.

293
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,350
The end.

294
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,920
I accept and thank
His Majesty's graciousness.

295
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,880
General Ye, Grand Princess Royal,

296
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,790
please rise now.

297
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,640
Mr. Attendant,

298
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
I wonder who this Prince Xuancheng is.

299
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,030
His Majesty issued two edicts today.

300
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,030
The other one

301
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,160
is to grant Prince Lin the title of
Prince Xuancheng.

302
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,030
Blessings come in pairs, right?

303
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,960
I see.

304
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,200
Mom, look.

305
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,240
Our Bingchang is such a lucky girl.

306
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,000
Even His Majesty cares about her.

307
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,590
Thanks for coming.

308
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,200
Please come in and have some tea.

309
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,480
Please.

310
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,720
Ye Bingchang is truly gentle and virtuous.

311
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,680
No wonder Lin likes her so much.

312
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,000
Isn't this a good thing?

313
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,070
Why did you sigh, Your Majesty?

314
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,680
Good thing?

315
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,110
Ye Xiao enjoys
a high reputation in the army.

316
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,110
His second son, Ye Qingyu,
who guards Jia Pass,

317
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,440
is not to be underestimated.

318
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,880
How can I not be worried?

319
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,270
It's rare for Lin
to ask something from me.

320
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,350
If this Ye woman becomes his first wife,

321
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,720
she's probably
gonna be the Queen of Sheng.

322
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,240
He doesn't want to fail his woman,

323
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,310
but I must consider the future of Sheng.

324
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,550
This is the dilemma of being a king.

325
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,790
I'm telling you Ye Bingchang,

326
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,510
no matter what you do

327
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,240
you're always the daughter of a concubine.

328
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,640
I just need to have a word with Grandma,

329
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,550
and you will

330
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,000
only deserve to be a concubine.

331
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,750
[Miss,]

332
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,160
[ever since you're a child,]

333
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,590
[when Miss Xiwu has something,]

334
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,680
[you don't necessarily have it.]

335
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,270
[But if it's something
even she can't have,]

336
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,510
[have you ever had it?]

337
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,880
Miss,

338
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,640

00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,320
[So, the power I devoured from the demons]

675
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,480
[will eventually run out.]

676
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,230
[If I know how to cultivate]

677
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,630
[like Xiao Lin does,]

678
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,230
[I'll be able to sustain my power]

679
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,480
[without devouring demons.]

680
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,360
[I wonder if that sect…]

681
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:00,960
Tantai Jin!

682
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,150
Tantai Jin!

683
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,630
Did you get injured somewhere?

684
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,670
Let me check.

685
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,550
We've been through life and death.

686
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,480
Don't be shy.

687
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,480
I'm not injured.

688
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,280
Even Xiao Lin,
who got excellent swordsmanship,

689
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
has multiple injuries.

690
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,550
While you remain unharmed?

691
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,710
Are you suspecting me?

692
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,880
No.

693
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,800
I was just saying

694
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,030
you're lucky.

695
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,070
Because I know

696
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,670
if you want to live, you gotta hide.

697
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,030
Unlike someone who ran around

698
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,630
like a headless fly.

699
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,760
I did that to save you!

700
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,840
You little ingrate!

701
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,840
If I didn't run faster,

702
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,630
you'd be killed by the birds.

703
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,920
Why did you come back for me?

704
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,230
Because I'm kind, duh.

705
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,590
I'd do the same for anyone else.

706
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,710
Back then everyone was

707
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,030
running out of the mansion.

708
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,920
Did you especially come back

709
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,400
just to save me?

710
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,190
I…

711
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,190
Because I love you, alright?

712
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,190
A couple should look out for each other.

713
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,630
Saving you is what
I'm supposed to do, huh?

714
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,360
You love me?

715
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,760
Just like in the novels,

716
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,510
in the beginning we didn't see eye to eye,

717
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,480
but eventually we grew fond of each other.

718
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,480
You saved me because of love?

719
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,480
What is love exactly?

720
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,150
Love is…

721
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,190
Love is you don't want him to die.

722
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,110
You wanna stay with him.

723
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,920
You'll be worried if you don't see him.

724
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,880
You'll be happy if you do.

725
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,480
[I'm sorry, Little Devil God.]

726
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,320
[I didn't mean to lie to you.]

727
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,480
[Love,]

728
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
[compared with power,]

729
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,000
[is truly something not worth mentioning.]

730
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,110
Alright.

731
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:34,880
If you love me,

732
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,150
why don't you teach me how to draw charms?

733
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,360
This way, we can spend more time together.

734
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,630
Why do you wanna learn that?

735
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,510
Because I want to be like you,

736
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,880
capable of protecting my loved one.

737
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,630
[Little Devil God actually has
someone he wants to protect now.]

738
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,280
Okay.

739
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,030
I'll teach you how to draw charms,

740
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,360
and you promise me to live on.

741
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,400
I don't wanna save you with my life again.

742
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,480
Okay.

743
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,620
[Ye Xiwu]

744
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,540
[Ye Xiwu]

745
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,980
[Ye Xiwu]

746
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,280
What are you doing here?

747
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
My words count.

748
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,280
I'm here to fulfill my promise of course.

749
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,480
Teach me.

750
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,190
What should I teach you…

751
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,760
The one you used to repel the crows

752
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,000
at Xiao Lin's that day.

753
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:33,920
Not that one.

754
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,800
That spell is too dangerous.

755
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,630
You're just an amateur,

756
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,000
and if you mess the charm up,

757
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,320
you might blow up the house.

758
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,760
[It's always wise to play safe.]

759
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,480
[Because you are Tantai Jin,]

760
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,480
[I will never teach you spells
that can kill.]

761
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,190
Then what are you going to teach me?

762
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,080

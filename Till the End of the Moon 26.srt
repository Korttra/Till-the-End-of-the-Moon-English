00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,680
Once the killing order is made,

337
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,590
Xiwu will certainly die.

338
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,830
Well, Qingyu,

339
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,920
What should we do?

340
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,400
I will try to convince His Majesty

341
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,830
turn her over to that three interdependent judicial departments for questioning before the trial.

342
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,270
Being inquired by three departments.

343
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,880
What if she tells us about the drugging?

344
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,960
Now her life is at stake.

345
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,510
I came back today to persuade you to leave home to avoid trouble.

346
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,480
Although Xiwu has severed ties with the Ye family,

347
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,440
His Majesty still may be angry.

348
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,310
Be angry?

349
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,920
So What?

350
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,070
Xiwu is the daughter of the Ye family.

351
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,070
As her gather,

352
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,400
although I cannot exonerate her,

353
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,680
I can't abandon her at this time.

354
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,110
Father, I…

355
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,790
Life and death are decreed by fate.

356
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,550
This time, I won't escape.

357
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
General Ye.

358
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,400
Please.

359
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,240
Father, you…

360
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,960
Since you have made up your mind,

361
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,960
I will not persuade you.

362
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,510
Please take care of your health, Father.

363
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,920
Eldest Brother,

364
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,110
please take care of our family.

365
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,640
[Ye Xiwu]

366
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,880
[Since you don't know how to cherish it]

367
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,310
[and want to die,]

368
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,110
[don't blame me.]

369
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,270
Your Majesty.

370
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,920
Your Majesty.

371
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,440
Hury up. His Majesty is awake.

372
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,240
Your Majesty, you are awake.

373
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,590
Get out, all of you!

374
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,440
Yes.

375
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,480
Get out, all of you!

376
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,480
Yes.

377
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,920
You Majesty.

378
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,400
What did the doctor say?

379
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,550
He said

380
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,750
he had never seen such a strange concealed weapon before.

381
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,880
It grows in the heart and veins in a few moments

382
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,830
and

383
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,750
it cannot be removed by external force.

384
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,590
Really?

385
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,000
It's OK to keep it in my body.

386
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,070
But Your Majesty,

387
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,550
these nails growing in the flesh

388
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
will be painful.

389
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,000
Then let it be painful.

390
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,920
Your Majesty.

391
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,590
How long will I live?

392
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,720
As long as Your Majesty recuperates well,

393
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
you will definitely get better.

394
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,160
Nian Baiyu.

395
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,400
You are not good at lying.

396
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,640
The doctor said

397
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,030
Your Majesty's heart and veins are damaged.

398
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,310
Even if he recuperates well,

399
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,510
he will not live more than three years.

400
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,030
So long.

401
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,670
It's really hard to go through.

402
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,150
Where is Ye Xiwu?

403
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,400
She's in the dungeon.

404
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,800
The jailer came to report that

405
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,760
from yesterday to now,

406
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,230
she did not eat or drink.

407
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,880
Dress for me.

408
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,920
But Your Majesty,

409
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,110
Your injuries are still fresh.

410
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,880
Dress for me.

411
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,070
Yes.

412
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,880
[It's because I like you.]

413
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,800
[OK?]

414
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,360
[A couple for one day has a hundred days of kindness.]

415
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,880
[Isn't it natural for me to save you?]

416
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,760
[So you've been lying to me since then.]

417
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,110
[What is love?]

418
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,110
[If you love someone, you don't want him to die,]

419
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,400
[and you want to stay with him.]

420
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,190
[You will be anxious if you can't see him.]

421
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,920
[You will be happy when you see him.]

422
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,150
[Everything is fake.]

423
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,280
[Everything is just a delusion of mine.]

424
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,110
[I was blind]

425
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,400
[to fall in love with you!]

426
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,480
[Tantai Jin.]

427
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,190
[I was supposed to come and kill you.]

428
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,630
[Ye Xiwu.]

429
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,030
[You are really the most heartless person in the world.]

430
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,110
[Almost invisible.]

431
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,110
[This is also the backlash of the World-overturning Jade.]

432
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,400
Ye Xiwu.

433
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,150
Do you think I'm stupid

434
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,400
and ridiculous?

435
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,710
You are locked in here

436
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,800
you can only see a beam of light when you look up.

437
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,480
You feel scared,

438
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,550
right?

439
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,550
I've been in the same mood

440
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,710
day and night these days.

441
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,190
Even when I was embroidering that veil for you,

442
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,880
I was scared.

443
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,800
When people stay in the dark for a long time,

444
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,670
they always look forward to the light of tomorrow.

445
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
But once they see it,

446
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,840
they will fear that at any moment they may lose it.

447
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,670
It's really what you're afraid of comes.

448
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,110
Now, in the world,

449
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,630
nobody can save me.

450
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,590
Just like your condition now,

451
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,110
nobody can save you.

452
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,230
Even if no one will save me,

453
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,110
I don't regret it.

454
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,070
Tantai Jin.

455
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,960
I once naively thought that

456
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,110
maybe I could be that light

457
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,920
in your darkness.

458
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,360
And I could make yo become a person.

459
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,590
But I was wrong.

460
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,800
Some darkness does not

461
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,920
deserve light.

462
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,320
It doesn't deserve.

463
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,070
It doesn't deserve?

464
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,920
Ye Xiwu.

465
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,360
Have a look.

466
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,070
I, Tantai Jin, a idiot.

467
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,710
You used to beat him, scold him, torment him.

468
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,510
And you even wanted to kill him.

469
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,960
But even so,

470
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,000
he still can't bear to kill you.

471
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,280
He was even full of joy

472
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,070
to marry you as his queen.

473
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,320
He looks forward to growing old

474
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,070
side by side with you.

475
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,960
He is so foolish.

476
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,030
Until you nailed him with those six nails,

477
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,920
he first came to his senses.

478
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,630
He really has no dignity.

479
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,280
[There is no Soul-slaying spikes.]

480
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,840
[The only chance to change the fate of the Three Realms]

481
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,590
[ was screwed up by me.]

482
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,800
[There is no point for me to live any longer]

483
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,190
[except to be humiliated]

484
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,840
Yes.

485
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,960
You have no dignity.

486
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,880
So I hate you.

487
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,190
Shut up!

488
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,710
I've done this to you!

489
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,230
Why don't you kill me immediately?

490
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,320
Do you have dignity?

491
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,400
Ye Xiwu.

492
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,440
How do you feel, Ye Xiwu?

493
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,550
This heartbreaking feeling is very painful, right?

494
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,760
Let me tell you.

495
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,880
This is not even a fraction of the pain I feel.

496
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,110
Tantai Jin.

497
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,190
Kill me.

498
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,230
Kill me now.

499
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,760
Although it is interesting to make fun with you,

500
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,320
I'm tired of it.

501
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,360
Kill me,

502
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,400
or…

503
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,630
In your dreams.

504
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,030
Did you think I would

505
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,360
let you off the hook so easily?

508
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,920
I will take you apart little by little

509
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,190
to see

510
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,440
What kind of heart

511
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,000
do you have in here?

512
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,360
Kill me.

513
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,440
Since

514
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,800
my affection means nothing to you,

515
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,070
have a taste of my hatred.

516
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:58,960
Your Majesty.

517
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,550
The doctors are outside.

518
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,070
Send them away.

519
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,230

520

No.

521
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,070
Send them to check

522
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,480
if Ye Xiwu is dead in the prison.

523
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,440
If you really hate her so much,

524
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,670
why would you keep her in the palace?

525
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,840
I hate her.

526
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,190
So I won't let her get what she wants.

527
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,760
She wants to run away.

528
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,280
She wants to die.

529

532

[I was once naive enough to think]

533
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,320
[that maybe I can]

534
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,150
[be the light in your life of darkness]

535

[but you must stay alive.]

539
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,480
[You made it. So did I.]

540
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,590
[We both survived.]

[Promise me you'll stay alive.]

[I won't let you die.]

543

[But I was wrong after all.]

544
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,510
[Some lives in darkness don't deserve lights.]

[be left alone in such darkness?]

Nian Baiyu.

550
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,440
Summon Ye Qingyu here.

551
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,190
I have things to say.

552
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,480
Understood.

553
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,070
How is His Majesty?

554
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,840
How is he?

555
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,920
He's in great pain

556
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
but has to bear with it.

557
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,320
What about Ye Xiwu?

558
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,920
His Majesty told me

559
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:38,710
that he wouldn't kill her.

560
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,480
She is safe for now.

561
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,880
But the prison

562
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,280
gets humid and suffocating

563
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,000
with pests everywhere in summer.

564
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,710
If she stays without food

565
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,440
or drinks,

566
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,710
she won't make it.

567
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,880
That silly girl is determined to die.

568
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,710
Mr. Nian, can I visit her?

569
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,150
Since His Majesty wants her alive,

570
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,670
go ahead.

571
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,840
Thank you for your kindness.

572
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,670
With my little sister in jail,

573
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,110
the whole family is worried.

574
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,280
That's why they sent me here.

575
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,550
We'll just talk a bit.

576
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,880
It's fine if you're only here to talk.

578
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,760
you didn't bring any prohibited items.

581

possibly help her break free?

582
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,920
Fine. Come with me.

583

584
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,960
Yes, it's me.

585

You've suffered.

588
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,440
Of course, I have to visit you.

589
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,840
You know.

590
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,190
I've always hated you

591
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,960
for being so condescending.

592
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:09,800
Since you don't want small talk,

593
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,760
let's get down to business.

594

595
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,840
I would like to know

596
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,440
if Tantai Jin had tasted that bowl of porridge?

597
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,320
Why didn't he die?

598
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,400
You know the porridge…

599
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:30,800
That's right.

600
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,190
You thought

601
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,110
you were the only one who added things in there.

602
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,440
What did you put in there?

603
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,800
Dry mylabris.

604
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:44,920
One tiny sip

605
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,510
is lethal.

606
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,190
[Ye Xiwu.]

607
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,360
[Did you]

608
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,840
[make this porridge specifically for me?]

[to save Xiao Lin.]

Why would you do that?

612
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,710
Xiao Lin is doomed because of that, you know?

613
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,280
Don't mention that name.

614

616

I had all my hopes up that day.

617
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,150

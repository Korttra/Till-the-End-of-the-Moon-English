00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,510
slit that kept man's coat.

172
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,150
Look at him showing off.

173
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,390
Ye Zeyu,

174
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,440
pay for it.

175
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
Hasn't Father taught you

176
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,790
an eye for an eye, a coat for a coat?

177
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,630
What?

178
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,000
What's wrong with you, Xiwu?

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
You paying or not?

180
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,030
Don't make me go to Father.

181
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,750
I'll pay.

182
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,360
Here!

183
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,200
Trollop.

184
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,200
Just ignore him.

185
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,910
This slit is too big to be patched.

186
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,680
Forget it.

187
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,750
You can't wear this anymore.

188
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,030
I'll get a new one.

189
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,670
You gave this to me.

190
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,870
It's mine now.

191
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,290
Alright. You keep it.

192
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,320
I'll have Chuntao buy you a new one.

193
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,490
Miss!

194
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,600
It's a royal edict!

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,080
Mr. Tantai is to have
an audience with the King.

196
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,800
[The Little Devil God still
has ties within the palace?]

197
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,290
[I must follow him to find out.]

198
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,170
[In case something fishy is going on.]

199
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,670
I'll come with you.

200
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,480
Tantai Jin is here to meet His Majesty!

201
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

202
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,310
Miss Xiwu,

203
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,910
His Majesty will only
meet Prince Tantai alone.

204
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,520
If you have nothing to do,

205
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,070
how about having a chat
with the Empress Dowager?

206
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
It's okay.

207
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,160
I'm pretty familiar with the palace.

208
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,670
I'll just take a walk.

209
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,670
Sure.

210
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,160
[The Devil God was raised in this palace.]

211
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,040
[What on earth did Tantai Jin go through?]

212
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,360
[How did he spend his days?]

213
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,280
[Why choose him as the Devil God?]

214
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,880
[If I saw the place he lived,]

215
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,310
[maybe I can find some clues.]

216
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,070
You there.

217
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,480
Miss Xiwu.

218
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,400
Do you know where Tantai Jin used to live?

219
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,830
Tantai Jin,

220
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,400
here's a letter from Jing Kingdom.

221
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,190
It was sent from the palace.

222
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Do you want to read it?

223
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,590
No.

224
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,550
Any normal person would want

225
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,070
to hear from his family.

226
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,310
When you say no,

227
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,880
it sounds like a lie.

228
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,070
For me, Jing Kingdom

229
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,480
is a thousand miles away,

230
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,310
to which I shall never return.

231
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,280
Emperor Jing is someone

232
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,280
I knew twenty years ago,

233
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,190
whom I will never reunite with.

234
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,590
He is but a foreigner in a foreign land.

235
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,590
I don't care.

236
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,480
Nor do I wish to care.

237
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,280
Do you mean that?

238
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,240
Do you know Emperor Jing Tantai Wuji

239
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,590
is about to die of an illness?

240
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,400
Your elder brother Tantai Minglang

241
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,120
has been made crown prince.

242
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,040
[I see.]

243
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,120
Noted.

244
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

245
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,710
Tantai Minglang is an ambitious one.

246
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,360
He's been waging wars against us,

247
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,590
and never bothered to care

248
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,640
about his younger brother's wellbeing.

249
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,160
Is he truly not afraid

250
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,040
that I might cut your head off

251
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,760
as sacrifice?

252
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,590
Tantai Minglang and I

253
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,640
are just strangers
who share the same blood.

254
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,430
He wouldn't care if I lived or died.

255
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,880
If you were to behead me as sacrifice,

256
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,760
I'm afraid that may be
exactly what he wishes.

257
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,550
He shows no mercy for you.

258
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,070
Have you never thought of

259
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,480
going back to Jing Kingdom

260
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
and taking back all that belongs to you?

261
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,710
[I see he's trying to play me
against my own brother.]

262
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,160
Your Majesty,

263
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,830
I've left my country for over a decade.

264
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,640
I am but a wanderer.

265
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,360
The people of Jing Kingdom

266
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,830
only acknowledge Tantai Minglang.

267
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,190
There's no place for me back there.

268
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,160
Besides, fate has a plan for us all.

269
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,910
The throne, the mortal land,

270
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,760
I'll leave these for others to compete.

271
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,790
This is my fate.

272
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,880
To be able to breathe is enough for me.

273
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,790
It seems

274
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,040
I was overconcerned.

275
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,550
You may leave.

276
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,430
This man has a heart of stone.

277
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,710
He baffles me every time I see him.

278
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,550
No wonder his old man
does not care for him.

279
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,360
Since he refuses to work for me,

280
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,790
he's useless now.

281
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,710
Have someone keep an eye on him.

282
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,480
He'll cause trouble as long as he's alive.

283
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,360
About what I mentioned before,
get it done quickly.

284
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,790
I've made arrangements.

286
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,910
Do be careful.

287
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,830
Find someone
of similar appearance and age.

288
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,550
Don't make any mistakes.

289
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,280
When the time comes,
I can give the Ye family a surprise

290
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,950
and disrupt the Jing Kingdom as well.

291
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,400
Wise move, Your Majesty.

292
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,670
Miss Xiwu, we're here.

293
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,910
This was where Prince Tantai had lived

294
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,590
before being sent to the Ye family.

295
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,150
You're after His Highness!

296
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,630
You're after His Highness!

297
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,200
You're after His Highness!

298
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,550
Ma'am,

299
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,790
it's a cold day.

300
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,480
Why are you on the ground?

301
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,590
Miss Xiwu,

302
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,480
this is nanny Yingxin.

303
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,040
I heard she's the one

304
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,480
who brought up Prince Tantai.

305
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,150
She followed His Highness here

306
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,630
from Jing Kingdom.

307
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,760
You're after His Highness!

308
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,280
You're after His Highness!

309
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,440
You're after His Highness!

310
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,150
Do you mean Tantai Jin? Who's after him?

311
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,630
I'd never cause him harm.

312
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,480
Your Highness, please hold on.

313
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,240
Chief Wu.

314
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,870
I haven't had the chance
to congratulate you on your marriage.

315
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,040
Congratulations.

316
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,150
Chief Wu,

317
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,040
let's drop the pleasantries.

318
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,630
I heard

319
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,870
that although you've married Miss Ye Xiwu,

320
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,280
the one you love is Miss Bingchang.

321
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,350
As we all know,

322
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,480
Miss Bingchang and our Prince Lin

323
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,040
see eye to eye with each other.

324
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
And General Ye

325
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,480
has long regarded him as his son-in-law.

326
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,480
Since you're now at the Ye Mansion,

327
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,550
this is rather convenient.

328
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,240
Could you keep an eye out for me?

329
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,310
What do you mean?

330
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,630
For proof of their collusion, of course!

331
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,920
Collusion?

332
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,520
You want me to help you frame
Xiao Lin and Ye Xiao?

333
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,520
What a poor choice of words.

334
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm His Majesty's close attendant.

335
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,200
Certainly, I should share his worries.

336
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,520
If you're willing to help,

337
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,280
not only can I guarantee you'll live long,

338
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,070
but I may also help you
marry your one true love.

339
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,070
[In this vast capital,]

340
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,680
[Xiao Lin is the only one
who has been sincere with me.]

341
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,350
[We're not close enough
to meddle in each other's affairs,]

342
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,070
[but there's no reason
for me to do him harm.]

343
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,110
I'm afraid I won't be able

344
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,070
to help you do that.

345
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,200
Don't ask for the hard way.

346
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,870
Don't forget what happened to Yue Yingxin.

347
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,590
How did she become like this?

348
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
This cold palace
has few visitors all year round.

349
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
We don't know when she went crazy either.

350
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,630
I just heard that

351
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,830
she's been like this

352
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,590
ever since Prince Tantai
left for Ye Mansion.

353
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,590
I didn't harm His Highness.

354
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,350
I didn't harm His Highness.

355
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,280
It's not me.

356
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,720
No. I didn't harm His Highness.

357
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,590
I didn't harm His Highness.

358
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,790
Don't you forget

359
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,040
where this place is.

360
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,440
Don't forget I'm in control of her fate.

361
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,520
It's up to me

362
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,680
whether she lives or dies.

363
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,870
Don't think you can live in peace

364
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,630
by being a docile son-in-law

365
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,760
with no say

366
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,920
in the Ye family.

367
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,760
I'll kill Yingxin if you don't comply.

368
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,920
But I won't let her die so quickly.

369
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,630
But I won't let her die so quickly.

370
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,040
I thought

371
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,920
you were just Xiao Liang's loyal dog.

372
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,720
I didn't expect

373
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,760
you to be a talkative one too.

374
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Tantai Jin, you…

375
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
His Highness wants you back.

376
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,040
Understood.

377
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,110
The hostage prince Tantai,

378
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,920
as for what I just said…

379
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
Chief Wu,

380
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,440
you were just catching up with me.

381
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,550
You're getting better at this, huh?

382
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,200
Alright, listen.

383
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,440
If you dare

384
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,760
tell anyone else about what I said,

385
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,630
I will make you regret being born.

386
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,040
A lowly son of a lowly mother!

387
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,390
[That Chief Wu talks too much.]

388
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,200
That Tantai Jin

389
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,720
thinks too highly of himself!

390
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,520
Godfather,

391
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,150
don't let anger consume your health.

392
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,440
About the one you told me to find,

393
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,630
I've got him.

394
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,000
It'll surely be enough

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,110
to fool those of Jing Kingdom.

396
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,960
No.

397
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,790
I just shared too many secrets with him.

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,310
If he is of no use to me,

399
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,000
I can't let him live any longer!

400
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,830
Tantai Jin must be killed tonight!

401
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,790
If he won't listen,

402
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,790
replace him with someone who will!

403
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,390
Godfather!

404
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:49,790
Godfather!

405
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,000
Godfather!

406
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,960
He's dead!

407
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,440
He's dead!

408
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,350
Lin,

409
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,830
you said you had
something important to discuss.

410
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,040
What is it?

411
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,150
Father,

412
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,630
many civilians of late

413
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,110
have gone missing in their sleep.

414
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,590
I suspect a demon has entered the capital.

415
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,310
I sent Chen Xian to lead the Dragon Guards

416
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,630
to investigate on the missing civilians

417
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,870
as soon as I heard the report.

418
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,200
I've arranged day-and-night patrols
in and out of the capital

419
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,070
to look out for the demon.

420
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,040
Father, please be careful
in the palace too,

421
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,200
in case the demon causes trouble.

422
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,480
Of all the princes we sent

423
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,870
to Mount Buzhao,

424
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,790
you're the most promising one.

425
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,520
You excelled the fastest
in your cultivation.

426
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,870
You've made great progress
in just three years.

427
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,720
But faced with demons like this,

428
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,550
I'm afraid you can't win for sure

429
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,720
with just three years of cultivation.

430
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Sorry to let you down.

431
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,550
It's fine.

432
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,150
I happen to have someone

433
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,790
who can be of use to you.

434
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,790
Prince Lin, we meet again.

435
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,440
Junior Martial Uncle!

436
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,310
So Master sent you here?

437
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,520
My sect brother said

438
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,520
the opportunity of my lifetime
would be in the capital.

439
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,720
He told me to spend
a few years here before returning.

440
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,550
What opportunity is that?

441
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,070
Well, I don't have a clue.

442
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,830
But at least I can help while I'm here.

443
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,480
The Barren Abyss Barrier
has weakened recently,

444
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,630
and demons are slipping through,
wrecking havoc in the mortal world.

445
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,790
You also know

446
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,280
that our Xiaoyao Sect

447
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,040
loves minding irrelevant things like this.

448
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,310
This is not irrelevant.

449
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,550
It's a big deal concerning people's lives.

450
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,630
Since Father appointed you
as Senior Chamberlain,

451
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,680
as an official,

452
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,520
you ought to protect your people.

453
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,680
Now that we are under attack by demons,

454
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,110
please help me subdue them right away.

455
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,680
Look how the tables have turned.

456
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,070
Back in Mount Buzhao
I was your Sect Uncle.

457
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,440
Now that I'm in the Sheng,

458
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,390
I've become your subordinate!

459
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,520
But the salary of a Sheng official

460
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,040
is simply too low.

461
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,520
I can't even feed my own mouth.

462
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,390
Let alone my family members.

463
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,870
Junior Martial Uncle,

464
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,200
you're adopting cats again.

465
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,550
You know me best.

466
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,870
[Little Devil God
had a hard life in the palace,]

467
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,720
[that's why he's so down and pessimistic.]

468
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,440
[The evil bone feeds on hatred and pain]

469
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,350
[to accumulate strength.]

470
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
[That's why Tantai Jin suffered so much.]

471
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,870
[Is this the fate of the Devil God?]

472
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,110
Buttercup.

473
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,390
It's late.

474
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,790
Why are you out on this windy night?

475
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,760
Aren't you cold?

476
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,550
Father, why are you home so late?

477
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,070
You must be tired.

478
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,200
Are you worried about me?

479
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,960
You've really grown up.

480
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,590
By the way,

481
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,350
if you got nothing important to do,

482
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,830
don't hang around outside.

483
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,040
Why?

484
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,790
The capital isn't safe.

485
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,150
Some civilians have disappeared
in their sleep.

486
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,480
Seems it's a demon's doing.

487
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,870
And another strange thing
happened in the palace.

488
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,150
His Majesty's loyal advisor
Chief Wu had an accident.

489
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,150
He chatted a little with Tantai Jin,

490
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,920
and died soon after going back.

491
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,390
His ears were bleeding.

492
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,920
The way he died was bizarre.

493
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,070
A wasp even crawled out of his ear.

494
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,630
[A wasp?]

495
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,200
[He talks to birds?]

496
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
[Yeah, and flies and mosquitoes.]

497
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
[and they chatted for a while.]

498
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,830
I won't say more,

499
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,590
in case my darling daughter
becomes too frightened to sleep.

500
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,110
Go to bed.

501
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,590
Miss, are there really
demons in this world?

502
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,110
Not only demons,

503
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,200
but also devils.

504
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,870
[Even when I left the palace
and hid in Ye Mansion,]

505
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,920
[they still wouldn't let me go.]

506
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,920
[I must find a way
to get out of Sheng Kingdom.]

507
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,870
Chief Wu,

508
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
you've lived long enough.

509
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,200
Go.

510
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
[With my current abilities,]

511
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,550
[controlling a couple of small creatures
is the best I can do.]

512
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,960
[I barely got out of danger this time.]

513
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,150
[Next time might be more challenging.]

514
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,280
[How do I know if he has awakened?]

515
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,350
[Little Devil God
doesn't have much power now.]

516
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,480
[If it was him who did it,]

517
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,350
[he must have used a curse or a charm.]

518
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,790
[If you murdered someone,]

519
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,480
[you'll definitely leave traces behind.]

520
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,630
Miss Xiwu?

521
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,000
[There's nothing on him.]

522
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,110
What are you dissatisfied with?

523
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,070
[I'll just have to trick it out of him.]

524
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,390
Chief Wu from the palace
suddenly died today.

525
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,480
Did you know that?

526
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,550
I heard that he stopped you

527
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,480
before you left the palace.

528
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,920
What did he say to you?

529
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,630
Nothing.

530
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,920
[So calm.]

531
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,310
[Is he really innocent?]

532
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,960
From today on,

533
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm gonna search you before you go to bed.

534
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,070
I'm warning you,

535
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,390
don't even think about
playing tricks on me.

536
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,070
Miss Xiwu's interests

537
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,000
are getting more and more intense.

538
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,040
Don't you start with me.

539
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,630
Who knows if you might have told

540
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,310
one of those wasps or bugs

541
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,310
to kill for you.

542
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,310
I don't wanna end up like Chief Wu,

543
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,110
dying for no reason at all.

544
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,630
[How did she find out?]

545
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,830
In this case,

546
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,790
searching my body doesn't seem enough.

547
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,110
How about

548
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,480
I take off all my clothes

549
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,630
so that you may be rest assured?

550
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,760
Go ahead.

551
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,150
Not my loss.

552
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,870
We're husband and wife after all.

553
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,870
I've already seen it all.

554
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,760
Go on.

555
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,870
You're not gonna do it?

556
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,110
Shall I do it instead?

557
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,870
[When did she become so much smarter?]

558
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,240
Be wary of your candles
during this hot summer!

559
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,200
Be wary of your candles
during this hot summer!

560
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,760
Be wary of your candles
during this hot summer!

561
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,350
[Grudge, hatred…]

562
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,070
[Fear, remorse…]

563
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,830
[You're the one!]

564
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,240
Help!

565
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,820
[East Capital Gate]

566
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,390
[As expected,]

567
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,070
[nowhere else has more nightmares]

568
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,870
[than this palace does.]

569
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,920
[With the aid of these nightmares,]

570
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,480
[I can cultivate more nightmare blossoms.]

571
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,390
The red string is up to your neck.

572
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,550
[You really look like a miserable one.]

573
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
[Why don't you leave here with me?]

574
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
[I sense a unique scent]

575
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,110
[outside of these palace walls.]

576
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,070
[It's not yet dawn anyway.]

577
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,520
[I'll go take a look.]

578
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,760
[It's right here.]

579
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,680
[It was worth the trip.]

580
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,440
[This scent is truly unique.]

581
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,070
It was mine to begin with.

582
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,600
Your Highness, don't go.

583
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,060
[Little sweetheart,]

584
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,660
[you're obviously a mortal,]

585
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,830
[but there's something demonic in you.]

586
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,390
[How very interesting.]

587
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,350
What a fruitful night I got.

588
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,870
Why don't you come back with me too?

589
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,630
[With the nourishment
of these miserable souls,]

590
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,480
the nightmare blossoms
will soon be everywhere.

591
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,000
[As long as they bloom
all over the woods,]

592
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,870
[I can evolve from a demon to a devil!]

593
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,980
[Ye Mansion]

594
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,590
[A demon in the capital…]

595
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,680
[Chief Wu's violent death…]

596
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
[Do they have anything to do
with the Little Devil God?]

597
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,240
What are you looking at?

598
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,760
There better not be leftovers.

599
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,920
Finish them.

600
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,680
Ye Xiwu,

601
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
you're so capricious.

602
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,200
Yeah.

603
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,040
Lately, I find myself enjoying
watching people eat.

604
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,040
Is there a problem?

605
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,200
When this month ends,

606
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,720
and you don't put on three pounds,

607
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,870
I'll give you a good beating!

608
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,760
[Her psychopathic ways
are becoming more unpredictable.]

609
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,240
Miss!

610
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,590
Miss!

611
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,310
Bad news! Miss Bingchang is missing!

612
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,200
What?

613
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,590
She was perfectly fine last night,

614
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,630
but she was suddenly gone this morning.

615
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,240
I'm afraid…

616
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,310
It's t-t-that… demon

617
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,310
His Lordship mentioned.

618
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,350
What should we do?

619
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,630
Calm down. Tell me in detail.

620
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,310
His Lordship sent
for the Senior Chamberlain

621
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,630
to exorcise demons in the mansion.

622
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,110
I hear Prince Lin is here, too.

623
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,280
I'll go take a look.

624
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,480
[She's still interested in Xiao Lin.]

625
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,280
[Good.]

626
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
[This way, no one will care]

627
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,920
[about Chief Wu's death.]

628
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,310
Butler Liu,

629
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,310
bring Jiahui back to have a good rest.

630
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,310
Yes.

631
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,870
Brother,

632
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,870
who's this guy?

633
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,110
He's the new Senior Chamberlain,
Pang Yizhi.

634
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,790
I heard

635
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,750
he's the direct disciple
of the Xiaoyao Sect,

636
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,710
and also the sect uncle of Prince Lin.

637
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,190
Catching demons is his specialty.

638
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,110
Then do you know who his master is?

639
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,080
I heard it's Immortal Qingxu
from Mount Buzhao.

640
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,590
[Never heard of him.]

641
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,710
[Could he be Uncle Zhaoyou's
great-grand master.]

642
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,080
No demon can escape from his eyes.

643
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,590
He can identify one in an instant.

644
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,270
When he strikes,

645
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,750
every demon dies in his hands.

646
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,400
[Oh, no.]

647
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,400
[He's a senior disciple of Xiaoyao Sect.]

00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,000
[that would be bad.]

651
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,590
[What now?]

652
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,150
Scholar Pang, anything I can help you with?

653
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,960
Junior Martial Uncle, what's wrong with him?

has a charming face.

657
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,000
He's bound to be rich and famous.

658
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,710
When you're rich, don't forget me.

659

Don't forget me, yeah?

660
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,190

to cast an array in your mansion

672
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,590
to search for that demon's traces,

673
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,670
and get Miss Bingchang back.

674
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,000
Sure, I'll be counting on you.

675
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,310
You mean

676
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,230
that well-cultivated demon

677
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,960
took them to Mount Banzhen
in the southern outskirts

678
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,270
and used these people

679
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,270
to plant flowers?

680
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,480
Yes.

681
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,310
Ye Bingchang and Yingxin

682
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,920
were both taken by that demon.

683
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,710
But it seems like that demon

684
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,000
doesn't plan on killing these people yet.

685
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,790
Why don't we share these clues with them

686
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,590
and have them rescue the kidnapped?

687
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,710
Got it.

688
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
You go check what Ye Xiwu is doing.

689
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,630
[Ye Xiwu's especially smart lately.]

690
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,400
[She's suspected me
of controlling animals.]

691
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,520
[If I tell her these,]

692
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,590
[it's no different from pleading guilty.]

693
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,670
[Forget it.
Why bother getting into trouble?]

694
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,480
[The demon-locking array]
The demon-locking array?

695
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,180
[Demon-locking Array]

696
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,710
It's here.

697
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Next step…

698
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,710
What's the next step again?

699
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,040
Where should this flag be planted?

700
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,150
The white flag corresponds
to the metal element.

701
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,590
I've tried this spot.
That one's wrong, too.

702
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,270
This doesn't make sense.

703
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,590
Not here.

704
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,710
[Will this poorly constructed array work?]

705
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,310
[Never mind.]

706
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,590
[I'll do it myself.]

707
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,670
[Thankfully, dad forced me to learn]

708
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,190
[how to draw spells for a few years.]

709
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,360
[Since I don't have any powers,]

710
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,710
[I can use this
for desperate times like now.]

711
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,630
[Scholar Pang,]

712
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,230
[I'll borrow some
of your incantation slips.]

713
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,670
[It's for the good of everybody.]

714
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,000
[Surely you wouldn't mind.]

715
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,000
[The misery in the mortal world]

716
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,150
[is indeed nightmare blossoms'
best fertilizer.]

717
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
[Traveling thousands of miles
from Barren Abyss]

718
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,040
[was certainly worth it.]

719
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,750
[Aren't these two]

720
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,630
[the ones I brought back just last night?]

721
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,080
[Their nightmare blossoms
have bloomed so quickly.]

722
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,040
[My judgment was right.]

723
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,040
[Let me see what's special]

724
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,110
[about your experiences.]

725
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,400
[So you're a maid from Jing Kingdom.]

726
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,400
[You followed a hostage prince
to Sheng Kingdom.]

727
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,190
Let go of me. Your Highness!

728
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,190
Let go of me!

729
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,960
[Who is this?]

730
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,960
[There's someone
with such a twisted fate?]

731
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,520
[He hasn't had a hint of warmth]

732
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,920
[or a glimmer of light in his life.]

733
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,440
[If I plant a nightmare blossom with him,]

734
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,440
[it'll definitely be
the best of its kind.]

735
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,040
[It can surely help me devilize.]

736
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,260
[Order]

737
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,710
[This demon-locking array]

738
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,400
[is like guarding
by a tree stump for a hare.]

739
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,230
[If the hare doesn't show up,]

740
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,630
[he won't catch a thing
in ten thousand years.]

741
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,920
Shoo!

742
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,360
Miss Xiwu,

743
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,480
are you alright?

744
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,150
I'm okay.

745
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,000
I was just startled

746
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,840
by this bird.

747
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,040
I think

748
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,230
if you don't tell them where the demon is,

749
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,110
they won't find a trace till dawn.

750
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,590
Who'd have thought Ye Xiwu

751
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,590
who fears nothing and no one,

752
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,590
would be afraid of a bird?

753
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,880
Please keep a distance from her.

754
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,560
Fine.

755
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,960
This woman is usually so mean

756
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,270
yet she somehow fears me.

757
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,480
[Nighttime is the best time.]

758
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,920
[I smell it.]

759
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,110
[Right there. He's the one.]

760
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,960
[I've never smelled such a sweet scent.]

761
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,710
[He can definitely grow]

762
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,150
[the most beautiful nightmare blossom.]

763
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,840
[Someone from Xiaoyao Sect is here.]

764
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,560
[I better be cautious.]

765
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,710
What was that?

766
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,360
The edict of the Heavenly Lord
reveals all hidden evil.

767
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,190
Demon-binding charm, purge all darkness!

768
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,230
Seize!

769
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,840
Prince Lin,

770
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,230
we caught it, didn't we?

771
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,630
Oh, no.

772
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,080
This black fog is a deceit.

773
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,590
It was a distraction!

774
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,520
That's…

775
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Tantai Jin's chamber!

776
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,420
[Ye Bingchang is on the southern outskirts
of Mount Banzhen]

777
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,840
[Now they can't tell who wrote it.]

778
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,400
[I have to think of a way]

779
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,110
[to slip this note to Xiao Lin.]

780
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,480
[Let him play the hero.]

781
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,520
[I can't arouse
Ye Xiwu's suspicion again.]

782
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,670
You're the one I've been looking for.

783
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,000
You will certainly flourish into

784
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,520
the most beautiful nightmare blossom.

785
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,710
By the light and power
of the mystic thunder,

786
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,440
strike!

787
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,880
You've overestimated yourself.

788
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,520
Tantai Jin, hold on to me.

789
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,230
Ye Xiwu, are you a fool?

790
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,230
You'll get yourself killed!

791
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,520
I can't let you die!

792
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,110
[What a pair of lovebirds.]

793
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,590
[Then you can come along.]

794
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,360
Miss Xiwu!

795
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm doomed.

796
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,590
She is General Ye's precious daughter.

797
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,040
He's gonna rip my head off!

798
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:57,960
Prince Lin,

799
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,000
nothing must happen to Miss Xiwu!

800
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,840
Miss Xiwu was kidnapped by the demon.

801
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,080
Ye Bingchang is in Mount Banzhen
in the southern outskirts.

802
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,520
I'm going to save her.

803
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,040
Could this scribble be some kind of trap?

804
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,190
It's our last resort.
I have to give it a try.

805
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,560
Bring the Dragon Guards. Let's go.

806
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,310
Okay.

807
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,000
[What is this place?]

808
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,400
[Susu,]

809
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,400
[that Devil God came like a storm.]

810
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,230
[You must stay and guard the gate.]

811
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,920
[I'll help the Sect Leader.]

812
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,630
[What?]

813
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,710
[Why is Sect Brother here?]

814
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,320
[And why am…]

815
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,010
[Listen to me.]

[Hengyang Sect's mantle
must be passed down.]

[Hengyang Sect…]

818
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,160
[But it's clearly…]

819
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,050
[Susu, wake up!]

820
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:56,760
[clearly…]

[Tantai Jin has been
killed by the succubus.]

[The Devil God has awakened.]

823
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,930
[You're about to fail.]

824

864

Passing by a remote and cold palace,

867
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,090

868
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,370
So what if I did?

869
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,050
You're always being so mysterious.

870

I guess she's still hunting.

873

She captured so many people.

874
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,970
And she's got her own barrier.

She's quite a mighty one.

No wonder Pang Yizhi couldn't catch her.

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,970
Ye Xiwu!

171
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,900
Gosh, you…

172
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,730
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

173
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,250
Every minute of tonight is precious.

174
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,970
What are you doing in my bed?

175
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,700
Do you want me to be assassinated
by Tantai Jin?

176
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,780
You go to his bed.

177
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,330
I'm not going.

178
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,330
You told me to play hard to get.

179
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:20,820
I…

180
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,210
As we're in the army,

181
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,940
we must always be on guard.

182
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,730
Tantai Jin is the leader of the army

183
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,330
and should set an example for his soldiers.

184
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,850
Ye Xiwu, you…

185
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,700
I…

186
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,090
You beat me.

187
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,730
I thought

188
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
you would run back in tears.

189
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,900
I didn't expect you to stick it out.

190
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,940
Ye Xiwu.

191
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,570
You really like Tantai Jin, don't you?

192
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,970
I…

193
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,940
Not very genuinely.

194
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,370
I'm just stupid.

195
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,700
I mean

196
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,090
I'm a dumbhead.

197
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,330
Pian Ran.

198
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,820
Let's sleep.

199
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,330
Good night.

200
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,090
Your Majesty.

201
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,970
What's going on?

202
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,900
Emperor Sheng, Xiao Yi,
stole the skeleton of Empress Dowager.

203
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,330
Quick… Hurry up.

204
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,020
Quick.

205
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,970
Pian Ran.

206
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,900
Tantai Jin.

207
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,820
Tantai Jin.

208
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,730
Tantai Jin.

209
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,540
Ye Xiwu.

210
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,060
Why is Tantai Jin suddenly leaving the camp?

211
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,700
What happened?

212
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,330
I have no idea.

213
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,300
I haven't been told, either.

214
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,970
Stay in your tent.

215
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,660
Don't come out, understand?

216
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,850
How much longer?

217
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,610
Your Majesty.

218
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,730
The spell will be done in a quarter.

219
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,020
Is your spell

220
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,900
really as good as you said?

221
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,730
I dare not lie to you, your Majesty.

222
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,780
The spell is super powerful.

223
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,660
No one can get rid of it.

224
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,700
The skeleton of Yue Ruanruan
has been crushed into ashes.

225
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,700
With Tantai Jin's maid

226
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,850
as the sacrifice offer,

227
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,570
I will burn them all together

228
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,420
when the time comes.

229
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,250
Tantai Jin will head for his doom.

230
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,540
He'll die of a sudden illness

231
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,370
in three mouths.

232
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,820
Three months is too long.

233
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,700
It's the fastest way.

234
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,370
All right.

235
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,610
Be quick. It's thundering.

236
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,250
Yes.

237
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,900
Your Majesty, what's that?

238
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,610
Your Highness,

239
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,660
there's a woman outside wanting to see you

240
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,420
for something important.

241
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,020
Let her in.

242
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:55,900
Yes.

243
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,820
Xiao Lin.

244
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,780
Miss Xiwu.

245
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,900
Are you alright?

246
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,420
What do you mean?

247
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,450
Anything strange happened tonight?

248
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,250
Did you come to send a message?

249
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,250
I'm afraid

250
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,970
Sheng Kingdom will
lose another battle tonight.

251
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,250
Your army is

252
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,530
the last army of Sheng Kingdom.

253
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,620
I heard they had followed my dad

254
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,900
in many battles.

255
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,250
If they're killed,

256
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,970
I'm afraid Sheng Kingdom will…

257
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,340
What did Tantai Jin do tonight?

258
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,050
He left the camp

259
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
an hour ago.

260
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,420
I thought he would take a night attack.

261
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,250
I've sent out all the scouts

262
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,140
but received nothing from them.

263
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,450
The Jing Kingdom's military is quiet, too.

264
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,490
Why?

265
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,290
[Tantai Jin.]

266
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,380
[What exactly are you trying to do?]

267
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,660
It's bad.

268
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,970
Miss Xiwu, get on your horse.

269
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,290
I'll ask Pang Yizhi to escort you back.

270
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,380
We can't let Tantai Jin

271
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,660
know you've come here.

272
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,010
Zhong Tai, Chen Xian.

273
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,900
-Ask Dragon Guards to defend the capital.
-Palace of Sheng.

274
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,140
It has been a long time.

275
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
How did you get in?

276
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,860
What's the demonic hex?

277
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,210
Xiao Yi.

278
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,140
You ordered someone
to excavate the graveyard of my mother

279
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,340
and take her skeleton to Sheng Kingdom.

280
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,100
Tantai Jin, you want to beat me.

281
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,140
Do you think I didn't know you ganged up

282
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,250
with Prince Xuancheng?

283
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,900
Given your crime,

284
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,450
how can I forgive you?

285
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,050
When you killed your brother
to seize power,

286
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,450
had you thought of getting punished?

287
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,210
It seems like

288
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,100
it was really you who gave the order.

289
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,660
These wizards.

290
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,770
You asked them to cast a spell
on my mom's skeleton

291
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,450
to kill me.

292
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,770
I'm not paying you to stand around.

293
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,490
Keep on.

294
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,810
Kill him.

295
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,250
Xiao Yi.

296
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,450
For your own prestige,

297
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,730
you caused the deaths of innocent civilians.

298
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,450
Protection!

299
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,620
In order to kill me,

300
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,490
you sacrificed your own people.

301
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,770
What's the difference
between you and demons?

302
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,700
I wanted to give you extra days.

303
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,490
Unfortunately, you're asking to die.

304
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,180
Shut up!

305
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,050
Sheng Kingdom is thriving now

306
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,100
and needs your head as a sacrifice.

307
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,860
Since you delivered yourself up,

308
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,010
I'll dispose of you.

309
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,250
At dawn,

310
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,940
the army of Sheng will conquer the Capital of Jing,

311
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,660
and I'll rule the world.

312
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,250
You want to kill me?

313
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,970
Arrest him.

314
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,340
What's wrong with you? Go!

315
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,530
Demonic cultivation.
You learned demonic cultivation!

316
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,420
No wonder Tantai Wuji
had kept you in the palace

317
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,530
and left you for death.

318
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,380
Tantai Jin.

319
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,450
You should have been killed by Tantai Wuji

320
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,210
if you hadn't been a hostage
in the Capital of Sheng.

321
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,700
Is this how you repay your debt to me?

322
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,290
I extraordinarily regret
having shown mercy on you.

323
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,970
I raised you in the palace.

324
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,380
Instead of feeling grateful to me,

325
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,380
you're actually being aggressive to me.

326
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,900
Xiao Yi, you're mistaken.

327
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,860
There's not even a trace
of affection between us.

328
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,940
In Palace of Sheng,

329
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,250
I had been living like an ant.

330
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,770
If there's someone I hate,

331
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,420
the person I hate the most is you.

332
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,340
Xiao Yi.

333
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,700
Kneel,

334
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,620
kowtow to my mother,

335
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,730
and apologize to her.

336
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,140
Then I'll leave your torso alone.

337
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,940
No way!

338
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,660
Drop to your knees!

339
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,530
Dream on!

340
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,620
Stop…

341
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,620
I'll kneel

342
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,770
and apologize.

343
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,050
Tantai Jin, you're doomed!

344
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,100
You monster,

345
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,180
why did you come back?

346
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,700
Why are you still alive?

347
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,290
You want me to apologize to her.

348
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,730
But it's you who should apologize.

349
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,940
Everybody knows

350
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,970
that your mother died giving birth to you.

351
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,100
You caused her death!

352
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,860
Tantai Jin, have you forgotten it?

353
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,660
You should thank me

354
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,580
for calling for the rain

355
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,810
and washing up everything.

356
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,580
Mom.

357
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,420
You are left with nothing.

358
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,210
You jinx, you're doomed.

359
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,250
Go to hell! You monster!

360
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,180
[You promised my mother to take care of me.]

361
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,340
[I'll repay you with the stab.]

362
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,860
[Yingxin.]

363
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,580
[You've suffered too much.]

364
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,660
[Death is a merciful release]

365
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,660
[for you.]

366
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,880
[Jialuan Hall]

367
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,140
Miss.

368
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,340
Miss, where can we go?

369
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,700
You're right.

370
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,940
Sheng Kingdom is conquered.
Where can I go?

371
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,860
Give me your valuable things,

372
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
or I'll kill you.

373
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,250
We don't have anything valuable.

374
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,380
Please let go of us.

375
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,340
Miss.

376
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,100
I wanted to rob you,

377
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,290
not kill her.

378
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,100
[All over the world,]

379
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,010
[besides Ye Xiwu,]

380
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,100
[there's actually no one I care about.]

381
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,250
Your Majesty, watch out.

382
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,490
Dragon Guards. You work for Xiao Lin.

383
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,970
Prince Xuancheng will be here in a second.

384
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,620
Tantai Jin, you can't escape.

385
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,210
News surely spreads fast.

386
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,730
But…

387
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,900
it's not your place to decide my fate.

388
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,970
Today,

389
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,900
I won't kill you.

390
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,010
Xiao Yi is dead.

391
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,340
I'll definitely rule the world.

392
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,730
Your Majesty.

393
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,730
[Tantai Jin.]

[The safest place]

399
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,050
[is Palace of Jing.]

400

Your Majesty, I'm Bingchang.

401
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,660
Your Majesty.

402

What do you want?

406
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,900
Your Majesty.

407

Now that Sheng Kingdom is conquered,

408
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,420
you've ruled the world.

409
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,620
I'm a weak woman

410
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,580
who has no one to depend on.

411
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,100
Your Majesty, I beg for your mercy.

412
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,810
Please take me with you.

413
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,250
All right.

414
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,530
Take her away.

415
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
Prince Lin, they all fainted.

416
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,210
[I'm late.]

417

[that Miss Xiwu went to]

422
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,580
[Xiao Lin's camp alone after we set off.]

423
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,380
[After that,]

424
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,010
[we encountered Dragon Guards.]

425

[Miss Xiwu is suspected]

426
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,940
[of treason.]

427

[Ye Xiwu…]

428
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,620
[Did you]

429
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,380
[write to me everyday because
you were worried about the Sheng?]

430
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,770
[Did you hurry to my camp]

431
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,730
[to protect Xiao Lin?]

432
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,860
[I can't believe you]

433

[betrayed me for Xiao Lin.]

434
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,250
Why is Bingchang here?

435
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,290
[Right.]

436
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,810
[Little Devil God is fond of her.]

437
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,700
Did you see my medicine?

438
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,050
Pian Ran.

439
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,700
What happened last night?

440
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,530
Did you find out about it?

441
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,860
They went deep into Sheng territory.

442
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,900
The Sheng will be destroyed soon.

443
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,180
By that time,

444
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,660
Tantai Jin probably won't need me anymore

445
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,860
and will let me go.

446
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,380
Do I sound too delighted?

447
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,140
I forgot you were from Sheng.

448
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,860
It's okay.

449
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,100
By the way,

450
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,770
I heard Tantai Jin came back with a woman.

451
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,660
A pretty one.

452
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,940
You should be careful.

453
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,730
All men

454
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,580
are unreliable.

455
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,770
You know, Ye Qingyu

456
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,450
got himself bruised

457
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,620
from head to foot

458
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,290
and got wet in the rain.

459
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,250
I found it.

460
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
[Tantai Jin went to the Capital of Sheng.]

461
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,970
[What exactly happened last night?]

462
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,450
[Why did he become like this?]

463
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,730
Tantai Jin.

464
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,490
Were you waiting for me in the camp

465
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,380
last night after I left?

466
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,850
Were you worried about me?

467
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,290
You left the camp abruptly last night.

468
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,370
What happened?

469
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,810
Do you want to know what happened to me

470
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,250
or what happened to Xiao Lin

471
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,890
or what happened to the Sheng?

472
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:40,930
Yes.

473
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,980
Tell me everything.

474
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:44,620
Okay.

475
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,370
I'll tell you.

476
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,890
Last night,

477
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,370
I went to Palace of Sheng and killed someone.

478
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,060
Ye Xiwu, you're afraid of me.

479
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,020
I'm not afraid of you.

480
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,100
Why should I be afraid of you?

481
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,850
Look at my eyes.

482
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,290
Don't lie.

483
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,500
Who did you kill?

484
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,660
A lot of people,

485
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,620
some of whom are familiar to you.

486
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,810
Let me think.

487
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,290
[Emperor Sheng, Xiao Yi.]

488
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,620
[Go to hell! You monster!]

489
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,250
[And Yingxin.]

490
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,700
You…

491
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
I cut Xiao Yi to pieces

492
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,500
and summoned the blood ravens.

493
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,980
The ravens gnawed him clean

494
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,210
and ate up his bones.

495
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,100
I ripped out Yingxin's neck

496
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,540
and burned her.

497
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,890
By the way,

498
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,930
I want to thank you for tipping off Xiao Lin

499
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,210
and brought him to the gate.

500
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,890
I was so close

501
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,060
to killing him last night

502
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,540
and feeding him to the blood ravens.

503
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,810
Tantai Jin.

504
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,460
I thought…

505
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,330
What did you think of me?

506
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
Did you think I was a righteous person?

507
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,290
Did you think
I was not insidious or calculating?

508
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,580
Did you think I wouldn't kill anyone?

509
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,980
Did you think I would forgive them

510
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,770
and let them go?

511
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,100
Or did you think

512
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,370
I was not a heartless freak?

513
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,770
[Right.]

514
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,540
[Devil God is born to be heartless.]

515
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,930
[I actually thought he would mend his way]

516
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,180
[and become a wise king.]

517
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,700
It's true.

518
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,500
You never changed.

519
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,180
You're always the Tantai Jin.

520
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,660
So do you regret it?

521
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,660
You regret staying with me.

522
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,770
You regret saying you liked me.

523
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,460
Yes.

524
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,810
I was blind.

525
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,290
How could I believe
human nature can be changed?

526
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,890
Nature? What nature?

527
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
I was being so stupid

528
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,290
for wanting to be with you,

529
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,930
cook for you every day,

530
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,370
and serve you.

531
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,620
Yet you killed someone at midnight!

532
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,140
I would rather

533
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,620
feed a dog than you!

534
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,370
Well said.

535
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,930
That's well said!

536
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,250
I've told you.

537
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,330
I'm born to be heartless.

538
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,060
Now I get it.

539
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,410
Tantai Jin.

540
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,540
[Whoever is around me,]

541
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,060
[whoever serves me,]

542
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,700
and whether they are you or others,

543
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,890
or there's no one,

544
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,410
it makes no difference to me.

545
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,980
Do you think I'm willing to serve you?

546
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,500
Then you get out of here!

547
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,540
Ye Xiwu.

548
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,700
Don't be too arrogant.

549
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,660
Watch your tongue.

550
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,540
Don't think I

551
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,250
will spare your life only.

552
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:33,930
Your Majesty.

553
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,730
Don't move, please.

554
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,660
You're seriously injured.

555
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,850
Yingxin

556
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,700
almost stabbed your heart.

557
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,660
Take the medicine.

558
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,730
We'll get a doctor
after arriving at the capital.

559
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,810
Keep it a secret.

560
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,930
Doctors can't cure the injury.

561
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,100
Her sword was attached to a spell.

562
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,060
What can we do?

563
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,180
It'll be scabbed after eight to ten days.

564
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,020
Put down the medicine

565
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,660
and get out.

566
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,370
Yes.

567
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,770
Is he here?

568
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,660
Yes… Do you want to go inside?

569
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,410
Who said I would go inside?

570
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,660
The ointment is good
for external injuries.

571
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,580
Yes…

572
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,930
Don't tell him I brought it.

573
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,890
Why can't I tell him you brought it?

574
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,060
Just do as you're told.

575
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,620
Don't be so curious.

576
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,210
If General Ye asks me about it,

577
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,770
I…

578
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,020
You tell him you found it
on the ground or got it out of water

579
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,810
or it dropped from the clouds.

580
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,100
Why?

581
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,180
You're just as obtuse as your general.

582
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,930
Who's outside?

583
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,460
Who is it?

584
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,540
Don't misunderstand.

585
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,700
General Ye's eldest sister

586
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,330
came to visit on His Majesty's order.

587
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,100
Why does she have to see her brother by order?

588
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,500
General Ye.

589
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,140
[It's her.]

590
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,330
General Ye.

591
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,980
Chief Pian brought you an ointment.

592
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,980
Thanks. Keep it.

593
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,620
Yes.

594
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,770
Pian Ran, this is my eldest sister.

595
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,890
Her name is Bingchang.

596
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,890
Bingchang, this is Pian Ran.

597
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,500
She's my…

598
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,140
My comrade.

599
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,100
Are you dumb?

600
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,980
Bingchang, thank you for visiting me.

601
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,810
You must be tired after the trip.

602
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,140
Take a good rest.

603
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:45,980
Your Highness.

604
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,850
The troops of Jing outflanked us last night.

605
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,930
We got caught up.

606
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,770
After the capital was conquered,

607
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,930
we had to escape here with civilians.

608
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,500
Did you count our troops?

609
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,250
Yes. Casualties account for nearly one half.

610
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,980
The wounded have been captured.

611
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,100
Half of our army is still remained.

612
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,620
They're our last soldiers.

613
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,930
The scout reported

614
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,730
the captured soldiers had been disbanded.

615
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,100
Side Concubine Ye is safe too.

616
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,540
Tantai Jin brought her

617
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,060
to his camp and accommodated her.

618
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,810
She is a woman.

619
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,810
I guess she was cornered into going with him.

620
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,890
You don't need to comfort me.

621
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,180
I'm glad Bingchang wasn't blindsided.

622
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,210
This war has nothing to do with them.

623
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,410
No matter whom she took refuge,

624
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,980
she's lucky to have survived.

625
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,410
Her family is in Jing Kingdom.

626
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,890
She can reunite

627
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,890
with her family there.

628
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,180
Let's forget about these annoying matters.

629
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,210
The emperor has died.

630
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,060
What's your plan?

631
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,100
That's right, Your Highness.

632
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,180
Sheng Kingdom is at stake.

633
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,730
We can't do without a mainstay.

634
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:52,730
That's right.

635
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,770
Sheng Kingdom

636
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,930
doesn't need the emperor anymore.

637
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,980
Where are the people who escaped

638
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:30,850
with the army?

639
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,140
Your Highness.

640
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,730
I have failed to defend the capital.

641
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,290
I'm sorry to have disappointed you.

642
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,980
Your Highness, don't be guilty.

643
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,020
Every country has a destiny.

644
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,500
It's not your fault.

645
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,140
Yes. Your Highness.

646
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,500
Your Highness, we got news.

647
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,060
Speak.

648
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,930
We got a secret report

649
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,410
that Emperor Sheng had failed.

650
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,180
He failed the formation
and infuriated Tantai Jin.

651
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,370
He was killed in his palace at night

652
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,100
and burned to ashes.

653
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,810
He's dead,

654
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,410
which is none of my business.

655
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,020
Yes.

656
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,980
I gave demon soldiers to Xiao Yi

657
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,770
because I needed him
to cover for my formation

658
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,500
on the southern border

659
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,770
and needed him to start the war

660
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,700
to pin down Tantai Jin for a while.

661
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,460
It's okay that he's dead.

662
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,700
The two countries are against each other.

663
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,540
No matter who's defeated,

664
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,850
it's not a bad thing.

665
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,890
Now that the formation is almost done,

666
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,810
the entire southern border will soon
become a poison fortress

667
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,250
and no life will survive.

668
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,730
Although Tantai Jin can read animals' language,

669
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,100
there won't be any messengers.

670
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,020
It's brilliant, your Highness.

671
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:05,140
Let's go

672
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,980
to see our inventions.

673
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,890
Yes.

674
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,020
[Have a taste.]

675
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,330
[I cooked it for a long time.]

676
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,410
Please make an exception for me.

677
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,890
I want to thank His Majesty in person.

678
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,810
You can't.

679
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,540
I left the Sheng in a hurry

680
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,620
and didn't have much money with me.

681
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,330
Buy yourself some things.

682
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,810

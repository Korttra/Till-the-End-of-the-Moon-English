[Episode 18]

17
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,630
I'm powerful enough to do anything,

18
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,190
but I still lost to her.

19
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,320
Ye Bingchang, you're awake, finally.

20
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,390
Who are you? Why are you talking to me?

21
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,110
After going through Bo're Life,

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,110
have you learned nothing?

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,390
You've been jealous
of Ye Xiwu since you were little,

24
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,110
but you couldn't do anything about it.

25
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,030
You could only lie to yourself

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,030
over and over again,
convincing yourself that

27
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,520
Ye Xiwu was the noble daughter

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,830
of a legitimate wife

29
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,800
while you're just
a lowly concubine's daughter.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,550
You believe
that's why you were inferior to her

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,360
and you didn't deserve everything she had.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,390
How pathetic!

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,470
Nonsense.

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,470
I don't need to compare with her at all.

35
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,390
Really?

36
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,000
But why did you take someone else's

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,270
love thread as your own?

38
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,160
Does your husband Xiao Lin
really love you?

39
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,520
What if you don't have

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,390
the extra love thread with you?

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,320
How did you know that?

42
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,910
Since having this treasure,

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,750
you've gained extraordinary charm

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,030
that can conquer many men, haven't you?

45
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,670
But good and bad things come in pairs.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
The succubus kidnapped you

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,320
because she was attracted
by this love thread.

48
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,190
So you're here to kindly remind me?

49
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,390
If you want to defeat Ye Xiwu,

50
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,440
you'll need more than love threads.

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,160
When in Bo're Life,

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,110
even if you were the goddess
of the Flying Serpent clan,

53
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,390
didn't she take everything from you again?

54
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,110
Tian Huan was born so noble.

55
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,240
If not for loving the wrong man,

56
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,550
how would she end up in dismay?

57
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,190
What exactly are you trying to say?

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,630
Life is short.

59
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,550
If you only rely on your good looks,

60
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,030
bet everything on a man,

61
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,750
and fail to seize the chances,

62
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,920
you can only and will always be a loser.

63
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,760
Tian Huan's tragedy

64
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,320
will be your future.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,230
I'm not Tian Huan,

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,040
and I have nothing to do with her!

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,640
Tian Huan has the power
of the flying serpent,

68
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,950
but all she knows is to be jealous

69
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,160
and try to please Ming Ye.

70
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,510
I'm nothing like her.

71
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,670
What's different about you?

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,760
In this world,

73
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,510
nobody is more worthy of my love than me.

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,600
Tian Huan is willing to kill for her man,

75
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,200
but I will only do that for myself.

76
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,040
Clever girl.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,390
May you be luckier than Tian Huan.

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,230
Tian Huan.

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
It's the God-slaying Lightning.

80
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Sang Jiu.

81
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,880
Sang Jiu, what's that?

82
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,760
It's a gem
that I forged with the divine essence

83
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,320
of the entire Flying Serpent clan.

84
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,480
This tiny piece
contains the powers of immortals.

85
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,000
It's capable
of overturning heaven and earth.

86
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,230
Why don't I call it
World-overturning Jade?

87
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,200
You want to use it to revive
your father and brother?

88
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,640
So are you here to stop me again?

89
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,550
Sang Jiu, don't use it.

90
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,390
You killed immortals
for their divine essence

91
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,760
and forged this evil object
with demonic fire.

92
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,830
It has harmed the heavenly harmony.

93
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,880
That's why the lightning punishment comes.

94
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,480
Be aware of the consequences.

95
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,480
Once you use its power,

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,440
you'll have to repay it someday.

97
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,230
You won't have a good ending.

98
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,470
A good ending?

99
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,350
From the moment
when I drew the Water-calming Sword,

100
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,910
I never thought of any good ending!

101
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,440
Ming Ye,

102
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,230
you mind too many of others' business.

103
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,960
Out of my way!

104
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,910
What?

105
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,200
You want me to pay them with my life?

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,640
No.

107
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,760
I just thought of another way.

108
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,750
Sang Jiu,

109
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,720
you don't have to be a demon anymore.

110
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,110
Everything

111
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,150
can still be saved.

112
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,520
What's your way?

113
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,110
With the so-called Bone-refining Seal?

114
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,550
Or did you borrow any treasure
from someone else?

115
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,710
The Bone-refining Seal has been sealed
by me in the Divine Platform.

116
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,790
You're right.

117
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,200
This shouldn't be a trade

118
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,320
or a favor

119
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,550
but compensation.

120
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
What are you up to?

121
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,670
Sang Jiu, look.

122
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,710
This is the God-slaying Lightning.

123
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,230
It is powerful enough
to shatter an immortal's soul.

124
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,110
It appeared

125

because of your breaking
the rules of heaven

126
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,670
and forging the World-overturning Jade.

127

Does it taste good?

666
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:35,560
Not bad.

667
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:47,730
Tantai Jin,

668
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,730
did you think I was funny

669
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,370
when I was chased by geese just now?

670
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,290
I saw that you're quite happy.

671
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,970
Did you have a tickle in your heart?

672
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,730
And you couldn't help smiling?

673
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,080
I did.

674
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,560
That's how happiness felt like.

675
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,120
What happiness? It's clearly evilness.

676
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,600
You enjoy watching me suffer.

677
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,000
[Little Devil God learned to be happy.]

678
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,000
[Has his love threads started to awaken]

679
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,410
[after being through Bo're Life?]

680
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,560
[Then as long as
I put more effort into it,]

681
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,480
[wouldn't success be in the bag?]

682
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,370
Enjoy your meal.

683
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,680
Where are you going?

684
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,200
Since you're already fine,

685
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,600
take a good rest then. I'm leaving.

686
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,560
You'll go back to the capital
in a few days.

687
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,160
Could you take me along?

688
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,250
You want to go back
to the Jing Kingdom with me?

689
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,890
If not for this,

690
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:16,890
why would I try so hard

691
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,200
to swim across the river?

692
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,120
Yeah.

693
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,200
I'm also wondering why.

694
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,450
Don't say anything
like "Following your husband everywhere."

695
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,970
On the ship back to the Jing Kingdom,

696
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:33,810
you made it rather clear.

697
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,000
You didn't want
to have anything to do with me.

698
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,040
Haven't you

699
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,770
left with Xiao Lin yesterday?

700
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,040
Why didn't you

701
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,000
just let him bring you back
to the Sheng Kingdom?

702
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,450
I just wanna go with you.

703
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,330
Ye Xiwu,

704
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:02,640
you've been weird
since you left Bo're life.

705
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,730
I'm telling you,

706
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,370
I'm not Ming Ye.

707
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,330
I'm not as righteous as he is.

708
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,600
I don't want to save the three worlds

709
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,330
or protect all the people out there.

710
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,200
I know you're not Ming Ye.

711
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,080
And I'm not Sang Jiu, either.

712
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,330
But they're a couple.

713
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,520
We're also a couple.

714
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,370
Sang Jiu and Ming Ye couldn't disentangle
themselves from the painful relationship.

715
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
We still have chances.

716
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,410
What's more, on my way here,

717
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,890
I met a lot of civilians.

718
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,850
[They don't care who the king is.]

719
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,000
[They'll go wherever]

720
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,160
they can sustain their lives.

721
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,640
You're a wise ruler.

722
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,410
Not only do I like you
and want to follow you,

723
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,560
everybody else thinks the same.

724
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:51,680
Ye Xiwu,

725
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,850
you're full of lies.

726
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,890
How can I trust you?

727
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,250
I'm here and at your disposal anyway.

728
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,850
Believe it or not.

729
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,480
At my disposal?

730
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,450
A royal maid?

731
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,770
Yeah.

732
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,080
Didn't you say you're at his disposal?

733
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,560
The royal maid's clothes
look good, though.

734
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,000
Not bad.

735
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,410
A cold monarch versus a mean handmaid.

736
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,330
This feels so right.

737
00:54:58,930 --> 00:54:59,640
Your Highness,

738
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,330
Fu Yu tried so hard

739
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,000
to save you from the brink of death.

740
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,890
Please take good care of your body.

741
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,970
Yeah.

742
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,450
Thanks to you.

743
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,730
I can still live with no dignity

744
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,770
in this dark cave.

745
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,120
Any news about Tantai Jin?

746
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,080
I heard Tantai Jin had conquered Jia Pass.

747
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,770
He'll be back in the capital soon.

748
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,810
Those spineless ministers in court

749
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,160
have all paid allegiance to him.

750
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,200
How is he qualified to be the King of Jing?

751
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:39,480
Your Highness,

752
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,450
whatever they do,

753
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,250
I'll always be by your side.

754
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,200
Did you find the people
I told you to look for?

755
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,370
Good.

756
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:56,890
Let them all in.

757
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,040
All of the best sorcerers

758
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,930
of Jing Kingdom are here.

759
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

760
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,810
You're all cultivators
who have seen the world.

761
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,080
I'll cut to the chase.

762
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,410
Do you know

763
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,250
how Tantai Jin obtained the ability
to use demonic hexes?

764
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,810
I heard he's been hunting demon creatures

765
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:31,930
to devour demonic elixirs.

766
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,480
-That's right.
-Devouring demonic elixirs.

767
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,730
It's a forbidden way of cultivation.

768
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:35,730
It's extremely risky.

769
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,600
How could you put yourself in danger?

770
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,410
Enough!

771
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,250
If Tantai Jin can do this,

772
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,410
why can't I?

773
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:49,250
I must let him pay for what he did to me.

774
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,730
I can't wait one minute longer.

775
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,900

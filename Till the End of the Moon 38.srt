and you are my most beloved daughter.

168
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,440
That's exactly

169
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,750
what I've been hoping for.

170
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,030
You are doing a stupid thing.

171
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,910
I have done a more stupid thing,

172
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,150
which is trusting you,

173
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,600
and because of that, my dad died.

174
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,080
I am your real father.

175
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,600
I gave you life!

176
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,790
Then I will give you my life back!

177
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,120
Let's die together today!

178
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,150
You dared to attack

179
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,750
your own biological father for an outsider.

180
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,550
Shut up!

181
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,240
Father went all over
the four continents to find me,

182
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,440
gave me life,

183
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,000
raised me to adulthood,

184
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,910
taught me to know right from wrong

185
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,600
and love all people.

186
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,440
His whole heart is devoted to me,

187
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,910
risking his life to protect my life.

188
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,550
In this life and this world,

189
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,510
I have only this one father.

190
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,840
And you,

191
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,630
you are only
the enemy that killed my father.

192
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,840
You and your mother
are truly of the same temper,

193
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,000
straightforward and stubborn.

194
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,030
Then she must

195
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,120
regret that she didn't kill you back then.

196
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,790
For ten thousand years,

197
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,870
I have endured endless
humiliation and suffering,

198
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,870
and finally I succeed today.

199
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,080
Not only do you not know
to congratulate me,

200
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,200
but you are also so rebellious.

201
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,390
I am too sad

202
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,960

you are so pathetic.

00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,160
go!

336
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,750
Jiumin!

337
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,680
Master!

338
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,270
You saved me again.

339
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,200
Silly kid,

340
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,200
don't forget, I'm your master.

341
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,480
Master,

342
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,400
why are we back to the Xiaoyao Sect?

343
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,070
I used Xiaoyao Sword-play

344
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,200
to set up a boundary here.

345
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,070
As long as I'm still alive,

346
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,590
this boundary can protect you.

347
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,310
Do they still think

348
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,270
that I stole the evil bone?

349
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes.

350
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,790
Do you still want to believe in me?

351
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,110
Of course I do.

352
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,960
In the world,
no matter who covets the evil bone,

353
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
it can't be you.

354
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,920
It was Di Mian. He has the evil bone.

355
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,270
Jiumin,

356
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,270
promise me

357
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,160
that you have to live well.

358
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,880
Master…

359
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,510
Master!

360
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,030
Don't go.

361
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,960
Don't go alone.

362
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,160
Remember my words,

363
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,790
live well.

364
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,830
Master!

365
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,270
Master!

366
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,270
You…

367
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,240
Jiumin,

368
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,590
I don't have much time left.

369
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,550
Di Mian has become the Devil God,

370
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,590
and the All-in-Distress Way has started.

371
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,070
When negative energy
fills Heaven and Earth,

372
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
the Three Realms

373
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,880
will be filled with suffering.

374
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,720
How?

375
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,590
Why?

376
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,030
Every formation has a weakness,

377
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,030
the All-in-Distress Way cannot be endless.

378
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,240
The All-in-Distress Way can be ended,

379
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,310
but only

380
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,590
the Devil God can do it.

381
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,070
The Devil God…

382
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,480
When the Devil God exists,

383
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,160
the All-in-Distress Way will exist.

384
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,590
When the Devil God perishes,

385
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,400
the All-in-Distress Way will perish.

386
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,400
Jiumin,

387
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,400
Do you know

388
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
why I gave you this name?

389
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,200
So, that's it.

390
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,720
When I found you near the Ruo-River,

391
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,510
I knew you're a jinx,

392
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,110
destined to be alone in your life.

393
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,960
I get it

394
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,000
that you've already know that

395
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,510
I'm the biggest disaster

396
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,720
back then.

397
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,590
But Jiumin,

398
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,720
you should know

399
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,640
that none is supposed to live

400
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,070
in the dark forever.

401
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,270
[You knew]

402
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,200
[I'm the devil fetus.]

403
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,070
[Yet you'd rather]

404
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,830
[give me a chance to re-choose my life.]

405
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,480
Jiumin,

406
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,680
help me up.

407
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,110
I wish to take another look
of our Xiaoyao Sect.

408
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,880
Master.

409
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,200
Master.

410
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,000
I have tainted by the power
of All-in-Distress Way.

411
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,720
No matter what living creature you are,

412
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,000
as long as you're infected by it

413
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,550
and your will gets weak,

414
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,440
you'll become a devil.

415
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,110
Jiumin,

416
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,110
I need you to do one more thing for me.

417
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,070
Kill me.

418
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,750
Not making me turn into a devil.

419
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,880
Master, please don't say like that.

420
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,590
I'll take you back for treatment.

421
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,160
Let's go.

422
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,790
Master.

423
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,920
Jiumin, kill me now.

424
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,590
Master.

425
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,200
Jiumin, I'm almost a devil.

426
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,480
Jiumin, a weapon can kill one

427
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,440
and it can also save one.

428
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,270
It's up to the good or bad purpose

429
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,960
of the one who uses it.

430
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,830
I can't do it, master.

431
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,790
Jiumin, quick to kill me.

432
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,240
I can't.

Or it'll be too late!

434
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,350

435

let me tell you a story.

00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,550
To restore her spirit, the Monstert of Drought

491
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,200
was sent into the man's world
for sufferings five hundred years ago.

492

She became the eldest daughter

Then,

505
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
tolerated her

506
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,640
and protected her

507
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,150
until the last minute of his life.

508
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,230
Ye Bingchang very regreted till her death.

509
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,960
The

510
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,800
the Monster of Drought regreted as well.

511
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,960
Later,

512
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,710
she woke up.

513
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,800
She still loved the life in the human world.

514
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,840
So she returned to the human world

515
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,280
and opened anembroidery workshop.

516
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
But

517
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,480
the fate is a teaser.

518
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,230
She met a fool

519
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,480
who looked exactly like Xiao Lin.

520
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,840
So she decided to cheat
and have fun with him.

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Right?

522
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,480
I thought

523
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,760
I can make up the regret to Xiao Lin

524
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,150
on you.

525
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,760
But, Gongye Jiwu,

526
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,000
I want to say thank you.
You make me understand

527
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that Xiao Lin will never come back.

528
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
I hated be cheated on

529
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,590
before,

530
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,070
But just now

531
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,150
I'd rather you cheat me.

532
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,880
Even you cheat my the whole life.

533
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,440
Why you don't do that?

534
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,190
You likes

535
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,960
very much

536
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,440
like him,

537
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,510
Gongye Jiwu.

538
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,030
You're a good person as well.

539
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Too bad,

540
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,550
you're not him.

541
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,360
[I tried every mean,]

542
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,280
[All-in-Distress Way still
can't be closed.]

543
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
[Now it is spead,]

544
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,590
[I don't have much time left.]

545
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,360
[Tantai Jin,]

546
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,550
[you need to find a way for this.]

547
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,070
[In Bo're Life,]

548
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,400
[with the help of the magic weapon,
the All-in-Distress Way]

549
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
[the Devil God's evil bone was taken out.]

550
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,510
[If I have them,]

551
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,230
[I can do it like that]

552
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,920
[to take out the evil bone.]

553
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,230
[If it goes well,]

554
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,630
[I can be killed]

555
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,550
[just like the Devil God back then.]

556
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,760
[Since the All-in-distress Way
lives and dies with me,]

557
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,070
[it will be ended]

558
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,230
[along with my death.]

559
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,630
Thank you, Devil God,

560
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,800
for avenging Si Ying.

561
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,030
Ye Bingchang?

562
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,280
I see.

563
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,880
After twists and turns of 500 years,

564
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,880
in the end,

565
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,670
no one can escape from fate.

566
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,710
I thought losing Xiao Lin

567
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,320
was like losing my life.

568
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,000
And I thought having a sister

569
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,510
who truly loved me

570
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,960
was a blessing from heaven.

571
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,320
But I didn't expect

572
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,760
it was meant for me to lose her again.

573
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,960
Why do you come to see me?

574
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,480
Ten thousand years ago,

575
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
the Devil God also saved my life.

576
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,670
Besides, what Si Ying wanted the most

577
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,000
was to follow the Devil God

578
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,030
and see his arrival with her own eyes.

579
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,920
Now she can't fulfill this wish.

580
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,110
As her elder sister,

581
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,320
I'll watch this till the end for her.

582
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,630
Tell me,

583
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,150
how can we make you the ruler of three realms

584
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,400
like ten thousand years ago?

585
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,840
As far as I know,

586
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,190
the three artifacts haven't returned yet.

587
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
The God-slaughtering Crossbow

588
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,840
and the Bone-refining Seal

589
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,670
are in the immortal sects.

590
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,710
But this is my own business.

591
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,400
What's between us has already finished.

592
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,360
Mo Nv,

593
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
you can go live your own life

594
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,630
even without Xiao Lin and Si Ying.

595
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,070
Tantai Jin,

596
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,110
you seem

597
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,230
different from the Devil God

598
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,510
I know.

599
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,400
It's a big world out there.

600
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
You can always find a place you like.

601
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,480
Qu Xuan Zi is dead.

602
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,630
Zhaoyou is dead, too.

603
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,590
What wonderful news!

604
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,800
Now there's only my seal
on the God-slaughtering Crossbow.

605
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,760
If it's heaven's plan

606
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,400
to take my son's life

607
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,000
but send the God-slaughtering Crossbow to me,

608
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,710
how can I give this treasure

609
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,630
to those clowns from Hengyang Sect?

610
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,000
I must put your power to good use.

611
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,840
From now on,

612
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,920
I am

613
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,590
the ruler of all sects!

614
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,710
I return the Devil God's eye

615
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,320
to you.

616
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,000
Sect Leader Cen was murdered.

617
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,070
[Glow and Thrive, Tao Is the Highest]
The God-slaughtering Crossbow was stolen.

618
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,760
Now all the leaders
of the three major sects are dead.

619
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,630
Only the Bone-refining Seal
of the three artifacts

620
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,150
is in our Hengyang Sect.

621
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,070
But who knows for how long we can keep it.

622
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,760
Tantai Jin really went too far.

623
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,280
Who exactly killed Sect Leader Cen?

624
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,550
According to disciples of Chixiao Sect,

625
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,670
it's done by a woman demon in red.

626
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,400
She looked a bit like

627
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,960
Si Ying the she devil.

628
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,920
[You completely changed me.]

629
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,400
[You gave me]

630
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,710
[a chance to live again.]

631
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,360
[I will never be contaminated
with the Devil God's power.]

632
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,800
[For you,]

633
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,440
[I'll keep this promise.]

634
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,110
[Tantai Jin!]

635
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,070
[What are you doing?]

636
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,800
[Tantai Jin has devilized.]

637
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,920
[He killed Sect Uncle Zhaoyou.]

638
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,800
[Now, everything you've done]

639
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,440
[is wasted.]

640
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,400
[However the fate may be like,]

641
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,760
[I can choose]

642
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,280
[between good and evil by myself.]

643
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,440
[I]

644
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,030
[shall never become the Devil God!]

645
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,070
[Only by killing the Devil God for good]

646
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,280
[can they feel rest assured.]

647
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,070
[And only in this way]

648
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,710
[can I really walk down this road with you.]

649
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,920
Susu,

650
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,670
come back with me.

651
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,880
Since the All-in-distress Way is activated,

652
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,670
it's not safe outside the sect.

653
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,190
Senior Sect Brother, just leave me alone.

654
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Now that I've left the sect,

655
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,880
I'll be responsible for my own life.

656
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,440
What are you going to do?

657
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,960
Looking for Tantai Jin?

658
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,360
What's the point of it now?

659
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,710
He killed his own master,

660
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,030
murdered people and snatched the crossbow.

661
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,840
He's probably in cahoots with Di Mian.

662
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,960
He's a monster with his hands full of blood.

663
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,150
You're still unwilling to believe it?

664
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,960
Li Susu,

665
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,070
use your reason.

666
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,960
You'll get yourself killed if you go.

667
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,880
Let go of me first.

668
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,630
What if he really had a reason?

669
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,190
I must be there whatever you say.

670
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,760
I must hear the answers from him.

671
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,960

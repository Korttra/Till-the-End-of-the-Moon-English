00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,400
His Majesty is fuming.

19

For a man like that…

53

Just treat him as if he's dead.

54
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,160
He mustn't die.

57
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,510
I thought you were just toying with him.

58
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,510
But you actually fell
into the pit yourself

59
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,160
and couldn't get out of it.

60

61

How do you explain this then?

62
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,160
Look at how listless you are.

63
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
You're no different
from a woman who was abandoned.

64

Actually, I dumped him.

65
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,750
Yeah, yeah. You dumped him.

[What exactly are you doing?]

68

Tantai Jin wiped out Sheng Kingdom

69
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,120
and ruined Xiao Lin's homeland and life.

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,680
And now, you are betraying him too?

71
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,270
Have you forgotten the vows
you made to him?

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,830
Why should I care about Xiao Lin?

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,430
He was incapable and broke his promises.

74
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,430
Because of him, I have to become a slave

75
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,510

76
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,070
I'm just trying to survive.

77
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,360
He has no power
to decide state affairs by himself.

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
Besides, he was deeply in love with you.

79

He truly loved you with all his heart.

80

Really? What if that love thread
didn't exist?

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,040
Wake up. He wasn't in love with you.

82
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Nobody is in love with you.

83
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,630
Men seem to be attracted to you

84
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,750
simply because you have two love threads.

85

109

By the way, how is Xiwu?

110
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,440
Lately, she and His Majesty…

They're both your sisters.

112

But you are partial to Ye Xiwu, huh?

113
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,750
You'll be fine after some time.

114
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,440
As the saying goes,
men can live without love.

115
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,670
But women can't.

116
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,240
But in my opinion,

117
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,630
there are plenty of silly men
in the world.

118

You're quite agreeable to my eyes.

So I have to make things clear first.

If you intend to seek someone

168
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,630
was indeed not appropriate.

169
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,630
But she was a woman after all.

170
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,910
Why don't you
have mercy on her, Your Majesty?

171
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,960
No need for that.

172
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
Your Majesty, you've
always been like this.

173
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,910
Now that I think about it,

174
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,550
Your Majesty and Bingchang
have known each other for so many years.

175
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,790
Back when you were a hostage
in Sheng Kingdom,

176
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,790
you had a rough life.

177
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Emperor Sheng saw you
as a thorn in his flesh.

178
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,440
I'd feel sorry for you
whenever I witnessed them

179
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,790
making things difficult for you
in the palace.

180
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,790
Now that you've united the world,

181
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,750
this world is your best compensation.

182
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,870
It's all in the past.
Now, Xiao Yi is dead.

183
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,320
I no longer

184
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,390
need any compensation.

185
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,510
Your Majesty,
you're as headstrong as always.

186
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,790
But I can't just pretend
to ignore the truth.

187
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,720
From now on,

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
let me keep you company.

189
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,200
Compensation?

190
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,910
Compensation is
the most pretentious thing in the world.

191
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Ye Bingchang,

192
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,390
you used to see me as a freak.

193
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
What? Are you not afraid of me now?

194
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,120
It's true that I used to fear you.

195
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,310
But now,

196
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,830
we are both loners.

197
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,590
I may understand some of your pain.

198
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,110
You've been in Sheng Kingdom
for over a decade.

199
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,790
And now, I'll spend
the rest of my life in Jing Kingdom.

200
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,830
We will keep each other company.

201
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,640
One day at a time.

202
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,480
I'm a bit tired. You may leave.

203
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

204
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,000
Bingchang.

205
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,510
Why are you so nervous?

206
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,270
Let's sit and talk, shall we?

207
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,200
What do you want to tell me?

208
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,640
Xiwu,

209
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,110
I'll cut to the chase.

210
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,880
Tantai Jin was in love with me long ago.

211
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,590
However, he couldn't have me
because of Xiao Lin.

212
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,880
You know that, right?

213
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,640
I know.

214
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,030
Now, I've got nothing left.

215
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
I have to depend on Tantai Jin

216
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,880
if I wish to survive.

217
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
He's my last straw.

218
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,680
Xiwu,

219
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,200
you won't snatch

220
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,960
this straw from me, will you?

221
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,510
No, I won't. I don't like him anyway.

222
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,750
If so, I can rest at ease.

223
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,830
Xiwu,

224
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,200
what you did to him
was indeed inappropriate.

225
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,880
It's normal that he's holding
a grudge against you.

226
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,350
But I'll ask him not to
put you on the spot

227
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,310
once I'm done coaxing him.

228
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,830
Your Majesty,

229
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,880
these are the nether puppet soldiers

230
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,440
I've cultivated for the past few days.

231
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,510
These puppets do not feel pain or fear.

232
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,790
You can command them with demonic power.

233
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,440
How many nether soldiers do we have now?

234
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,720
Your Majesty,

235
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,440
including the prisoners

236
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,110
sent by Emperor Sheng a few days ago,

237
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,000
we have 4,000 of them.

238
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,240
Tantai Jin has 100,000 Jing soldiers

239
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,350
and tens of thousands of Firewing Army.

240
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,920
Can someone tell me

241
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,880
how can I conquer the Capital of Jing

242
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
with just these 4,000 puppets?

243
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
Your Majesty, Sheng Kingdom has perished.

244
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,350
Tantai Jin has united Sheng
and is at the peak of his power.

245
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,830
I'm afraid we cannot conquer
the Capital of Jing

246
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,510
in a short period.

247
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
Your Majesty,
please gather our forces for now.

248
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,510
Useless fools.

249
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,240
Fu Yu,

250
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,000
don't let them fool me again.

251
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,640
You'll suffer the consequences

252
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,270
if you can't figure something out
in a month.

253
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,920
Tantai Jin.

255
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,200
Tantai Jin.

256
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,480
Ye Xiwu.

257
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,720
You're back?

258
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,680
Tantai Jin, do you love me?

259
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,000
I…

260
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,790
Why aren't you daring enough
to own up to it?

261
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,070
Are you afraid that I'll despise you,

262
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,160
be disappointed in you, and abandon you
when you say that?

263
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,720
Stop that!

264
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,720
See? You're always like this.

265
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,270
Forget it.

266
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm going to fall in love
with someone else.

267
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,240
Being with you isn't fun at all.

268
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,720
Ye Xiwu.

269
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Let go of me!

270
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,200
Ye Xiwu, come back!

271
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,680
Were you dreaming just now, Your Majesty?

272
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,400
Please rest early if you're tired.

273
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,640
Dreaming?

274
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,310
You're born without a love thread.

275
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,750
So you can't experience real emotions.

276
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,200
You won't feel happy or scared.

277
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,750
[How could one without
a love thread even dream?]

278
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,200
So, this is what you call a dream.

279
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,550
Speaking of which,

280
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,160
I had fallen in love with you

281
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,110
back in Bo're Life.

282
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,550
I swore to marry nobody but you.

283
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,200
You'd committed all kinds of evil deeds
in Bo're Life.

284
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,270
Are you trying to do the same now?

285
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,350
It was just a dream.

286
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,000
Why did you bring it up
when you knew that was just a dream?

287
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,350
Ye Bingchang, answer me.

288
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,110
Does being with me these days

289
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,920
make you happy?

290
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,110
Staying by your side

291
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,960
was what I desired the most.

292
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,590
Answer my question. Are you happy?

293
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,510
Naturally.

294
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,960
You're lying.

295
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm speaking from the bottom of my heart.

296
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,110
Sheng Kingdom just perished,
and Xiao Lin went missing.

297
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,000
You came here from a foreign kingdom
just to keep me company.

298
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,440
Why would you be happy?

299
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,480
After Ye Qingyu surrendered,

300
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,110
he never fawned on me even once.

301
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,240
Although I convinced him to serve me,
he also feared me.

302
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,480
As for you,

303
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,200
you chose to be together

304
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,790
with the ruler who just conquered
your state and destroyed your family

305
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,030
just to seek shelter.

306
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,720
How could I trust you?

307
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,000
Your Majesty, are you despising me?

308
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,590
Have you forgotten

309
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,720
how horribly Ye Xiwu treated you

310
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,200
when you were in Ye Mansion?

311
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,030
Even so, Your Majesty still
took pity on her, right?

312
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,550
I'm just a woman

313
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,640
who's trying to survive

314
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,790
in troubled times like these.

315
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,200
Is one act of survival

316
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,680
nobler than another?

317
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,830
Ye Bingchang,

318
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,240
in my heart,

319
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,200
you're worth nothing compared to Ye Xiwu.

320
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,310
Your nobleness

321
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,200
has nothing to do with me.

322
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,240
[Tantai Jin,
how dare you insult me like this?]

323
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,960
Buttercup.

324
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,880
Come on.

325
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
Eat up.

326
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,240
Thank you, Grandma.

327
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,640
Look at you.

328
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,270
How come you became so much thinner?

329
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,400
I think it's because of the heat.

330
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,790
I heard that Tantai Jin
granted Bingchang the title of

331
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,550
Madam Xuancheng as soon as

do you love Bingchang?

480

I brought her back from Sheng Kingdom

481

482
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,280
I thought you'd be happy about it.

483

Once,

484

People say that
the sun is bright and warm.

488
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,070
But I didn't know what true brightness

489

meant.

490
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,880
So,

491

when I saw how Xiao Lin
treated Ye Bingchang,

492
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,800

493

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,480
It turned out that it wasn't love at all.

496
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,110
At first, I was wondering

497
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,840
why I had so many strange feelings

498
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,360
when I was together with you.

499
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,440
It was only clear to me after you left me.

500
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,030
I am able to love someone

501
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,710
only because that person is you.

502
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,150
Ye Xiwu,

503
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,590
the one I love

504
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,960
is nobody but you.

Tantai Jin.

506
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,630
That was pretty mushy.

507
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,070
Every single word I said
came from the bottom of my heart.

508
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,670
And it took me a long time

509

disappointment, jealousy.

sourness, and sentiment after
spending time with you.

515

You have taught me all of these feelings.

516
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,480
I'm willing to try to be a good person.

let me be merciful and tell you one thing.

614
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,800
You trained at Xiaoyao Sect before.

615
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,630
Have you ever heard of love threads?

616

All intelligent beings have them.

617
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,440
You can't love someone without them.

618
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,480
I was once married to a man.

619
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,360
His name was Jiang Rao.

620
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,070
I gave my love threads to him.

621
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,190
But he went to the battlefield

622
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,670
and died.

623
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,550
Thus, my love threads were lost.

624
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,230
You resemble him so much.

625
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,280
He was also a dumb soldier.

626
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,880
He spent all his days on the battlefield.

627
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,110
So, you…

628
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,880
That's right.

629
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,590
I wouldn't have saved you

630
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,400
with my powers

631
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,880
if you didn't resemble him.

632
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,150
Now, I have no love threads.

633
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,760
I cannot fall in love.

634
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,510
But since you resemble him,

635
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,960
I'll provide you with two options.

636
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,150

spending my life with you?

637
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,360
Fine.

638
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,150

639

640
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,880
What? You are not even willing
to change your name?

641
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,000

if I agree to it,

644
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,670
not only will I humiliate myself,

645
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,960
but I will also taint the relationship
between you and Jiang Rao.

646
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,480
Ye Qingyu,

647
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,840
I thought you were an idiot.

648
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,630
But I didn't expect you to be a lunatic.

649
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,550
Fine. You're not willing to do it, huh?

650
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,320
The world is filled with men

651

this momentary pleasure with me.

652

in my duties,

00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,590
I would like to ask Your Majesty
for a reward today.

662
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,150
Tell me. What do you desire?

663
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,670
I'm just a wild fox
that came from the hills.

664
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,840
I hate being tied down.

665
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,150
Your Majesty, please give me the cure

666
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
and set me free.

667
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,630
You desire to leave?

668
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,440
You got a lot of nerves.

669
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,840
But if you do leave,

670
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,760
Ye Xiwu will be upset.

671
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,760
It's not like I'm going to vanish.

672
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,190
If Miss Xiwu wants to see me,

673
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,550
she can still do so.

674
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,360
It seems like

675
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,190
you're determined to leave.

676
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,000
Pian Ran,

677
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,230
doesn't the Jing Kingdom

678
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,760
have anything worth staying over?

679
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,070
It looks like there is.

680
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Wait a minute…

681
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,440
I have given your antidote

682
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,480
to Ye Qingyu.

683
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,670
Why did you give it to him?

684
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,360
That's my weak point.

685
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,710
He asked for it early in the morning.

686
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,150
Does he know that I'm leaving?

687
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,760
General Ye is honest and hardworking.

688
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,440
He knelt before me
and made a vow this morning.

689
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,590
That's why I gave it to him.

690
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,030
You can ask him for the antidote

691
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,070
if you desire to leave.

692
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:28,920
You…

693
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:32,550
Tantai Jin, you scum!

694
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,630
I pray that you stay alone forever!

695
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,800
You…

696
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,880
What a feisty fox.

697
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,540

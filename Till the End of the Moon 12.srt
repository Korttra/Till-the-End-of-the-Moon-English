please don't kill him!

113
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,750
He absorbed the crystal
because he was dying

114
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,670
after being injured by the Devil God.

115
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,550
He was dying?

116
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,510
What a coincidence!

117
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,360
How did he happen to fall
into my Mohe River

118
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
and take the Water-calming Crystal!

119
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,550
I… I brought him here.

120
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,630

122
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,550
No!

123
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,270
Ming Ye was already breathing his last.

124
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,270
This place has
the most abundant divine energy.

125
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,120
I can only bring him here.

126
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,790
Besides, demon soldiers were after him.

127
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,200
I went to lead them away,

128
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,590
but I didn't expect
he'd absorb the crystal.

129
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Did… Did you kill any
of the Devil God's men?

You've brought
a terrible disaster to us today!

133
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,440
Father, please calm down.

134
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,960
Dad,

135
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,240
since I caused the trouble,

136
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,440
I shall take the responsibility.

137
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,160
If the Devil God wants to catch the killer,

138
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,640
just hand me over to him.

139
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,720
You take the responsibility?

140
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,400
Father!

141
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,830
Are you capable of that?

142
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,960
Without the Ancient Crytal,

143
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,830
the Water-calming Stone
loses its energy source.

144
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,510
The Mohe River will be muddy and billowy.

145
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,160
All of our people
will suffer heavy casualties.

146
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
So many lives of them…

147
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,030
How… How are you going to repay them?

148
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,240
The people of Mohe River
suffered a catastrophe today

149
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,920
because I failed to discipline my daughter.

150
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,110
Unionid Tribe is always
kind and peace-loving.

151
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,830
Now that we've lost
our ancestors' blessing,

152
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,070
we'll definitely suffer from retribution!

153
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,440
The energy source was lost

154
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,790
all because of me.

155
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,830
I should make up for it.

156
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,590
What are you doing?

157
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,750

[My divine essence]

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,160
[I've made a mistake.]

168
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,110
I've extracted my essence
to atone for my crime.

169
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,110
I only wish that the Mohe River

170
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,350
would be clear and calm.

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,110
Jiu!

173
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,510
Jiu!

174
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,440
Jiu!

175
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,310
Father,

176
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,400
all the aquatic residents
have been appeased.

177
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,750
Please go have some rest.

178
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,680
I'll watch her.

179
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,590
Your sister is asleep now.

180
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,880
I can stay with her for a little longer.

181
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,590
If she wakes up and gets angry at me,

182
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,480
she might not want to see me.

183
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,350
You know what,

184
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,790
your sister has been clingy
since she was a kid.

185
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,480
Every night before she went to bed,

186
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,200
she'd ask me to tell her like ten stories.

187
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,000
And she could only sleep
while grabbing my beard.

188
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,750
She was so young back then.

189
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,590
Her hair was short and sparse.

190
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,400
But she kept asking me

191
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
to braid her hair every day.

192
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,440
Father.

193
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,070
I shouldn't…

194
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,000
I shouldn't have hit her, should I?

195
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Ever since she was born,

196
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,790
she wasn't wronged for a single bit.

197
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,750
She must've done this

198
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,240
because I hit her.

199
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,310
She wasn't being reckless.

200
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,160
She has grown up.

201
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,000
She's the princess of Mohe River.

202
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,720
She's saving her own people.

203
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,720
But…

204
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,000
She has lost her divine essence.

205
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,310
The path of immortals and demons diverges.

206
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,240
She's been learning
immortal arts since she was young.

207
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,920
Now without her divine essence,

208
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,440
she won't be able to achieve immortality.

209
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,880
This won't do.

210
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,550
I can't just leave it like this.

211
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm still alive.

212
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,590
[The Devil God ambushed me.]

213
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,590
Thank you for saving my life.

214
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,550
the God of War,

215
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,160
I don't deserve your gratitude.

216
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,750
I'm not the one to save your life

217
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,030
or mend your immortal soul.

218
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,000
Your savior is the Ancient Crystal

219
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
we used to calm the river.

220
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,880
This is the bottom of the Mohe River?

221
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,920
I heard the Unionid Tribe
has lived here for generations

222
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,240
and governs its territory.

223
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,030
I presume that you must be King of Mohe River.

224
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,310
How generous of you

225
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,200
to save my life with your treasure.

226
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,880
I don't know how to repay you.

227
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,200
No need.

228
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,680
We're just a small spirit clan.

229
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,200
How dare we ask for rewards
from the God of War?

230
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,110
I don't think I've offended you ever.

231
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,160
Would you be frank with me?

232
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,400
You're the noble God of War.

233
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,960
We don't deserve to be your friends.

234
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,110
It's all because of my helpful daughter

235
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,510
who brought you back.

236
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,270
That's why you had the chance

237
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,750
to steal the Ancient Crystal!

238
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,310
I've never stolen anything.

239
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,590
Please be careful with your words.

240
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,070
Did you not do it,

241
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,790
or did you forget it?

242
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,680
Could it be that the crystal

243
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,350
just flew from the Water-calming Stone

244
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,310
into your chest all by itself?

245
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,640
Or am I blackmailing you

246
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,110
with ten thousand

247
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,480
of our people's lives?

248
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,110
When I was shot down
by the God-slaughtering Crossbow,

249
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,790
I lost consciousness.

250
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,200
I really don't remember
what happened later.

251
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
Whether you admit it or not,

252
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,400
the crystal has been exhausted by you.

253
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm afraid you can't deny that.

254
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,550
As for what will happen to Mohe River,

255
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,550
you don't need to worry about it.

256
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,270
My daughter Sang Jiu
invited a fox into the henhouse,

257
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,350
which cost us our most important treasure.

258
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,790
She knew she had made a huge mistake.

259
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,310
So she extracted her divine essence

260
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,830
in replacement of the crystal.

261
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,270
May I have the chance

262
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,070
to meet Miss Sang Jiu?

263
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,110
I want to thank her in person.

264
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,880
Thank her?

265
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,110
Sang Jiu is my only daughter

266
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,920
and the princess of Mohe River.

267
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,270
For you, she lost her divine essence

268
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,880
and gave up her chance
to achieve immortality.

269
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,590
So you're just going to say thank you

270
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,350
and let it go?

271
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,000
Is that all the gratitude
you have for her,

272
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,440
and for the Mohe people?

273
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,640
As long as it's within my capabilities,

274
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,160
I'll do everything I can to compensate her.

275
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,350
I wonder how you would like me

276
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,480
to show my gratitude to the Mohe people?

277
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,790
Sang Jiu is the hope of Mohe River.

278
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,240
Now her future is ruined for you.

279
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,550
If you are willing to marry her,

280
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,680
protect her, and take her
to the immortal realm,

281
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,640
I'll let bygones be bygones.

282
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,440
I've never met Miss Sang Jiu before.

283
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,720
There's no love between us.

284
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,270
This is such a hasty marriage.

285
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,440
Let's not discuss if I'm willing first.

286
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,350
Will she agree?

287
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,480
That's our family business.

288
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,200
I'm asking you now.

289
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,550
What about you? Are you willing or not?

290
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,160
Brother, you're here.

291
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,350
How are you feeling?

292
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,070
Is Father still mad?

293
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,640
How's the river like now?

294
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,680
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

295
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,240
Brother.

296
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,510
Something wrong?

297
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,680
Jiu,

298
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,030
Father let Ming Ye
sign a marriage contract.

299
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,590
Ming Ye will come marry you in three days.

300
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,160
Why?

301
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,590
Dad arranged this?

302
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,030
Did Ming Ye agree?

303
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,030
You sacrificed
your divine essence for the Mohe River.

304
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,070
No matter how hard you train,

305
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,880
you'll never be able to leave this river.

306
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,350
Dad doesn't want to see you like this.

307
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,480
So he convinced Ming Ye

308
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,510
to take you up to the Shangqing Realm

309
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,750
to cleanse your essence and cultivate.

310
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,790
There's nothing bad staying in Mohe River.

311
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,000
Aren't you and dad both here?

312
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,590
Just tell me.

313
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,240
Are you willing to marry into
the Shangqing Realm?

314
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,830
I…

315
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,400
Jiu, listen to me.

316
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,550
Dad is picking a good future for you.

317
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
If you're not willing,

318
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,070
no one can force you to do that.

319
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,550
You can stay home forever.

320
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,070
You can be with father and I.

321
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,110
Understand?

322
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,510
It's your own marriage.

323
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,960
I won't urge you.

324
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,400
You think it through properly.

325
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,830
If you're not willing,

326
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,720
I'll convince father to burn this contract.

327
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,400
Take your time.

328
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,310
Just tell me your answer within three days.

329
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,510
Brother,

330
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,790
I'm willing.

331
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,510
Have you ever thought that

332
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
Ming Ye has never met you?

333
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
He'll naturally not love you.

334
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,590
But I love him.

335
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,340
[Sang Jiu.]

336
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,590
You…

337
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,750
You've really made up your mind?

338
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,270
I wanna be close to him.

339
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,400
I wanna see the God of War whom I admire.

340
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,200
I wanna see
how the Shangqing Realm looks like.

341
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,510
You used to say

342
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,240
that I was a small girl with big ideas.

343
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,030
This time, just let me
make my own decision.

344
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,750
I'm gonna need you to help with my wedding.

345
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,920
Alright.

346
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,030
Take a good rest then.

347

[you're gonna have to carry on alone.]

352

Lord Immortal,

353
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,640
the auspicious time is coming.

354
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,350
Please let me help you get changed.

355
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,720
No need to trouble you.

356
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,750
I'll do it myself.

357
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,750
-Yes.
-Yes.

358
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Sister Ruby,

359
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,550
does the God of War hate us?

360
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,510
He doesn't want us to serve him.

361
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,400
No need to take it to heart.

362
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,550
Those servants from the East Sea

363
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,510
told me that

364
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,030
he preferred to be alone
even when he hadn't immortalized.

365
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,350
And he used to be a soldier.

366
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,310
He really can't get used to being served.

367
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,720
Goddess Tian Huan is about to wake up soon.

368
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,550
When she's there, don't get too close.

369
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,270
If she sees you,

370
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
you'll probably have trouble.

371
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,510
Does anyone in Shangqing

372
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,880
not know what she desires?

373
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,030
She's been in love
with Lord Immortal for years.

374
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,270
Now with the new bride coming,

375
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,550
what hope does she have?

376
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,350
I used to think you were pretending it,

377
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,510
but it turns out you are really foolish.

378
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,160
This thing is all over the realm.

379
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,640
Haven't you heard how the marriage came?

380
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,510
The so-called bride is actually

381
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,920
a clam spirit in the Mohe River.

382
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,110
They're blackmailing him.

383
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,310
They say that last time
the God of War fell into

384
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,270
the Mohe River and used their…

385

[Jiu,]

Let me give it a try.

390
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,350
See what dad is doing now.

391
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,640
It's the clothes I used to wear.

392
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,710

Ming Ye, the God of War.

395

Before you leave,

396
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,710
a kind reminder from the Mohe River.

397
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,840
Maybe in the eyes of the immortal realm,

398
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,480
the people of Mohe River

399
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,840
are as insignificant as duckweeds.

400
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,030
But Jiu

401
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,230
is my father's only precious daughter.

402
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,880
Jiu isn't born a brave girl.

403
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,030
But she killed four demons to save you.

404
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,550
Mohe River is a barren corner,

405
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,510
but it offered you its crystal to heal you.

406
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,360

[Are you willing or not?]

My poor daughter

465
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,320
lost her divine essence for saving you.

466
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,800

really doesn't seem to have seen the world.

492

What do you expect anyway?

494
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,280
I'm afraid she has never seen

Your Highness,

500

we saw Madam was having a good time.

We didn't dare to interrupt her.

502
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,960
That's why we forgot to remind her.

503

The God of War.

00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:26,960
Miss Sang Jiu.

505
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,800
Miss Sang Jiu,

506
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,400
Is there anything?

507
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,190
I…

508
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,230
The God of War…

509
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,230
You can just call me Ming Ye.

510
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,960
Ming Ye,

511
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,400
I was waiting for you last night.

512
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,960
But you didn't come.

513
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,320
So I accidentally fell asleep.

514
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,840
Did you come afterwards?

515
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,760
Did I oversleep?

516
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,630
Sorry.

517
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,190
Actually,

518
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,840
I should be frank with you last night.

519
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,360
We haven't met before.

520
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,480
There's nothing between us.

521
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,880
Although we're married,

522
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,880
it's not out of my own will.

523
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,630
I guess you must think the same.

524
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,880
Since we're not actually husband and wife,

525
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,030
for our future life,

526
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,590
why don't we make three rules?

527
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:49,920
First,

528
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,150
you may enter or leave
this Yuqing Palace freely.

529
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,630
I won't get into your bedroom.

530
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,630
You and I will act on our own

531
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,550
and not disturb each other.

532
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,150
Second,

533
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,760
you're my wife nominally,

534
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:07,190
but you can't use your title
to bully others.

535
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,440
Third,

536
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,550
if you have anyone you love in the future,

537
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,280
feel free to marry him.

538
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,590
I can write a letter to Clam King

539
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,190
to divorce you.

540
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,510
I've got military affairs to attend to.

541
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,840
Excuse me for not keeping you company.

542
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,360
Sister Ruby,

543
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,630
you guessed right.

544
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,920
She looks kinda pitiable in this case.

545
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,190
What's pitiable about her?

546
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
The Unionid Tribe was blackmailing

547
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,800
our Lord Immortal for saving his life.

548
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,800
They'll reap what they sow.

549
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
Otherwise, should we be friendly to her?

550
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,510
Speaking of which,

551
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,230
we still don't know the name

552
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,440
of that little clam spirit.

553
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,510
I'm Sang Jiu.

554
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
Mad… Madam Sang.

555
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,670
Madam Sang.

556
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,000
What are your names?

557
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,880
I… I'm Beryl.

558
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,030
She's Ruby.

559
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,630
Two sisters,

560
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,030
actually, I wanna ask you something.

561
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,400
Do you know what the God of War

562
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,760
likes in his daily life?

563
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,590
If I wanna spend more time with him,

564
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,710
what should I do?

565
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,960
Lord Immortal doesn't seem
to have any hobbies.

566
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,550
He doesn't like to be close
to anyone, either.

567
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,510
If he's not training soldiers,
he'll be at war.

568
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,360
His life is quite hard.

569
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:48,920
So Goddess Tian Huan

570
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,840
often cooks soup with spirit herbs

571
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,360
for Lord Immortal as tonics.

572
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:52,960
Also…

573
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:57,710
Madam,

574
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,920
we're just lowly maids.

575
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,030
How are we supposed to know how to do that?

576
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,800
I understand.

577
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,960
So he loves training and war.

578
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,230
Now that I'm married,

579
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,110
I can't be lazy and sleep in anymore.

580
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,480
I'll get up early and practice with weapons.

581
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,550
If I'm admitted as an exception,

582
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,480
wouldn't I be able to get close to him?

583
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,510
Maybe I can even help

584
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:28,510
in the war.

585
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,960
Madam, you've got
quite a unique way of thinking.

586
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,550
By the way,

587
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,800
that Goddess Tian Huan you just mentioned,

588
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,590
who is she?

589
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,480
Goddess Tian Huan

590
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,510
is the only daughter
of the previous God of War, Tian Hao.

591
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,030
He used to be the owner
of this Yuqing Palace.

592
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,030
Lord Immortal followed Tian Hao
for many years.

593
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,960
For Lord Immortal,

594
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,110
Tian Hao is both his benefactor

595
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,480
and his brother in arms.

596
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,030
Before Tian Hao died,

597
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,670
he entrusted Tian Huan to Lord Immortal.

598
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,840
Therefore, he often looked out for her.

599
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,920
Madam, please don't overthink.

600
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,070
Is she that pretty fairy

601
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,510
with a very tall chignon?

602
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,550
I heard she's still in a coma.

603
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,110
Can I go visit her?

604
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,670
The Goddess is still
in seclusion in the Bihan Hall.

605
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm afraid she prefers not to be visited.

606
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,320
Alright then.

607
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,760
When she wakes up,

608
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,710
please remember to tell me.

609
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,630
I'll go see her.

610
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,510
But the God of War
only needs immortal soldiers.

611
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,630
He can't take in

612
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,230
a little spirit without divine essence.

613
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,260

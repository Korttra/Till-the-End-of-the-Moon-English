[Episode 13]

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,920
Lianhua,

19
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,310
put away these flowers for me.

20
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,710
Lord Immortal,

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
where do these flowers come from?

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,230
Where else can it be?

23
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,040
From the garden of God of Wood.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,680
Lord Immortal,

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
you just stole her flowers.

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,310
There are countless flowers in her garden.

27
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,150
I only clipped a few tiny branches

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,150
just for the sake of the scent.

29
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,150
Take them back and put them in the jade vase.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,430
Remember to change water everyday.

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,750
I… I dropped them.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
You little brat.

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,800
You've been absent-minded and careless

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,120
in your cultivation every day.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,750
Now you've lost my flowers.

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
If this goes on, how can you immortalize?

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Lord Immortal, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,560
Show me your hand.

39
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,960
I have to teach you a lesson today.

40
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,400
Go.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,310
Find my camellias back.

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
If you can't find them,

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,520
don't ever come back.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,520
You get it?

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,800
Yes.

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,000
Just go.

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
The gods and demons will eventually have a war.

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,750
I can't see through the causes and effects.

49
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,750
You're bound to have a

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,630
worldly relationship with these camellias.

51
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,840
Lianhua,

52
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,400
go cultivate and hide in the mortal world.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,870
You've just got happily married.

54
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,870
Why are you willing to

55
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,560
leave your beautiful wife and go out?

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
Today the twelve gods gathered

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,800
to discuss the solution to eliminate demons.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,310
I can't be absent.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,960
You're no fun at all.

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,710
My jokes don't work on you.

61
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,910
So boring.

62
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,120
Chu Huang, you came so early.

63
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,190
I'm just getting some air,

64
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,560
in case when you guys arrive later,

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
you'll nag me to sleep.

66
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,560
Ming Ye suddenly got married at such a young age.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,000
So many fairies are crying their eyes out.

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,310
Had I not known

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,360
that you're the most descent man there is,

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
I'd think that you've had

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,560
an affair in the Mohe River.

72
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,630
Even you're making fun of me.

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,190
No need to explain.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
We all know how it is.

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,240
The only problem is

76
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,160
how are you gonna treat Goddess Tian Huan?

77
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,950
I've no personal feelings for Tian Huan.

78
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,390
She used to be my subordinate,

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,830
and she will remain so.

80
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,390
It's good if you know that.

81
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,310
Now you've married this

82
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,480
clam spirit princess.

83
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,190
Although you're of two races,

84
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,920
you can't give her the cold shoulder.

85
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,680
I understand.

86
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,480
My eyes see through previous and after lives.

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,070
How about I take a look for you?

88
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,190
See how this marriage goes?

89
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,480
Little Ji Ze,

90
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,160
quit showing off your abilities.

91
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,680
Even though we're all gods,

92
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,040
our marriages are determined by our own actions.

93
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,600
The innocent have no sorrow.

94
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,310
Just let him live his own life.

95
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,480
Everyone's here.

96
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,510
Let's go.

97
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,270
Without my divine essence,

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
a large part of my shooting power is lost too.

99
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,720
Watch out!

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,040
Who's up there?

101
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,240
It's me.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,120
You…

103
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,750
What are you doing up there?

104
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,240
I saw that these fruits were nice

105
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,720
and no one's here to pick them.

106
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,270
So I wanted to eat some to quench my thirst.

107
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,630
Are…

108
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,630
Are they edible?

109
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,390
Aren't these your fruit trees?

110
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,630
You haven't taste any?

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,310
I…

112
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,120
The Xiannai trees have been growing
in Shangqing for 10,000 years.

113
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,040
They were always on their own.

114
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,070
No one has ever picked their fruits.

115
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,830
Gosh.

116
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,510
Don't tell my these fruits are expensive.

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,270
I've eaten a lot of them.

118
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,120
But you…

119
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,040
Why do you eat everything you see?

120
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,870
What if they were poisonous?

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,190
No, they're not.

122
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,830
I won't pick any.

123
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,630
Why don't you try one?

124
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,870
I…

125
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,630
Just try one. It's super sweet.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,510
I'm going back to my room.

127
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,240
Morning!

128
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,120
They do taste good.

129
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,840
Thank you.

130
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,270
You're so awesome, Madam!

131
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,150
My arm hurts so much.

132
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,200
Be level with the arrow.

133
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,000
Raise your arm a little.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,120
This may save you a little strength.

135
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,200
What do you mean?

136
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
Draw the bow one more time.

137
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,870
Raise your arm high.

138
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,480
What did you say?

139
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Nothing. I'm leaving now.

140
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,440
I didn't say anything.

141
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,270
Why was he being shy?

142
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,630
This bow works better.

143
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,840
Ming Ye,

144
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,790
I like the bow you gave me.

145
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,120
A gift for a gift.

146
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
I'll take you to see some good stuff.

147
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,960
Be there or be square.

148
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,630
The shooting stars here are so beautiful!

149
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
When I was in Mohe River,

150
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
I used to look up to the sky.

151
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,270
That's where the most beautiful stars are.

152
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,720
I love this.

153
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,150
I wonder if you love this or not?

154
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,960
What?

155
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,320
Something's not right!

156
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,550
What do you mean?

157
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,630
Normally Ming Ye

158
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,200
would spend 12 hours in the military camp.

159
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,150
He's ready for battle all year round.

160
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,630
But these days,

161
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,910
he keeps heading home.

162
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,480
Aren't all married men like this?

163
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,120
This won't do.

164
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm gonna see what kind of beauty

165
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,000
this little clam spirit is.

166
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,870
She change Ming Ye's unchangeable routine?

167
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,720
What are you gonna do?

168
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,150
Let's go.

169
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,480
We haven't been to Yuqing Palace for long.

170
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,080
Let's ask for a cup of tea from Ming Ye.

171
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,390
If anyone doesn't know you,

172
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,630
they'll take you as a thief!

173
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,440
Good heavens!

174
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,390
Is this still the Ming Ye I know?

175
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,960
Did my eyes serve me right?

176
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,630
This move may not only hurt your war mates,

177
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,670
it will also leave you defenseless,

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
and give your enemies chances to hurt you.

179
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,510
Then let me try again.

180
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,670
Try again.

181
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,360
Raise your arm.

182
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,440
Did you see?

183
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,270
I mean the sword, not me.

184
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,600
Exchange moves with me.

185
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:14,910
Okay.

186
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,910
I obviously saw this sword

187
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,360
going in that direction.

188
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,360
Why is it here?

189
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,150
Goddess Chu Huang, why are you like Ji Ze?

190
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,240
Coming without appointment.

191
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,030
Because you're hiding your wife from us.

192
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,080
If I notice you in advance,

193
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
will I be able to see this harmonious scene?

194
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,600
You scared me.

195
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,390
Your little wife is so good.

196
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,840
One single move and my face is nearly ruined.

197
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,750
I didn't control my move.

198
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
It's not Sang Jiu's fault.

199
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,080
Your remarks were just sour grapes.

200
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,240
Sorry.

201
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,670
I was being careless.

202
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,550
Lord Immortal, are you alright?

203
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,600
Did I scare you just now?

204
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,320
I didn't expect that we're connected in a way.

205
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:06,960
Ji Ze,

206
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,240
what do you mean?

207
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
You'll understand when the time comes.

208
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,680
It's just that you and she both know,

209
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,680
but Ming Ye and Sang Jiu don't.

210
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,830
What do you mean?

211
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,920
Sang Jiu, my little friend.

212
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,920
I visited you on a whim.

213
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,270
I didn't bring you any gift.

214
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,030
How about I give you four words?

215
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,640
Remember why you came.

216
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,680
Guess it's something not for us to know.

217
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,510
Miss Sang Jiu,

218
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
you don't need to ask in detail.

219
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,030
You just need to remember what Ji Ze said.

220
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,160
It'll be useful someday.

221
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,720
You're Ji Ze,

222
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,680
the God of Time?

223
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,240
That's me.

224
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,790
This is Chu Huang,

225
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,030
the Goddess of Space.

226
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,270
No wonder.

227
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,590
Just now this sword obviously flied forward,

228
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,070
but it fell by my side.

229
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,590
So it's due to your divine power.

230
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
Miss Sang Jiu,

231
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,830
I don't know why,

232
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,110
but you seem so familiar to me.

233
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,310
I didn't bring any gift for a sudden visit.

234
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,160
Shall I give you a wisp of divine power?

235
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,830
What's this?

236
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,790
It can connect you and Ming Ye.

237
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,960
As long as you wish,

238
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
you may see him across time and space.

239
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,640
But you can only use it once.

240
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,070
Thanks.

241
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,920
It turns out that you're here to send gifts.

242
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,590
Aren't we here for the tea?

243
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,160
Let's go to the tea room.

244
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,880
Since Lord Tian Hao fell

245
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
and you took over his palace,

246
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
I've never come here once.

247
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,590
Speaking of which, how's Goddess Tian Huan?

248
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,590
She's already recovered.

249
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,070
But she hasn't come to herself yet.

250
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,640
Jiu, what happened?

251
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,960
Brother,

252
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,640
why am I like this?

253
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,400
Jiu,

254
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,030
your demonic energy has started to devour you.

255
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,240
I am a spirit to begin with.

256
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,070
How can I be devoured by demonic energy?

257
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,960
You used to have divine essence.

258
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,270
You practiced immortal arts since young.

259
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,680
Your core and meridians
were the same as immortals'.

260
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,270
Now that your divine essence is lost,

261
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,480
your demonic nature is back after some time.

262
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,640
Foul energy grows inside you.

263
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,480
It's like feeding meat to a rabbit

264
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
and feeding grass to a tiger.

265
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,880
If you don't deal with it carefully,

266
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,270
I'm afraid you may lose your sanity.

267
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,310
Then what should I do?

268
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,440
You've been married into Shangqing
for over a hundred days.

269
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,750
Did Ming Ye…

270
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,070
He never tried dual-cultivation with you, right?

271
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,510
No need to lie to me.

272
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,960
If he's willing to do that,

273
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,440
he'll be able to neutralize

274
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
your foul energy with his clear energy.

275
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,480
That way, not only will you not be devoured,

276
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,240
you'll be able to maintain your immortal body.

277
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
And you can advance your cultivation level.

278
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,680
Back when father

279
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,350
insisted that you be married there,

280
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,880
he did that partly for this reason.

281
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,960
What?

282
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,590
Did that flood dragon treat you badly?

283
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,160
No.

284
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,880
Ming Ye is a good person.

285
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,750
A good person?

286
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,160
He leave you all to yourself for so long.

287
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,160
What's good about this husband?

288
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,550
Jiu, come back.

289
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,510
Father and I will

290
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,240
find a way to suppress your demonic energy.

291
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
No, I can't go back yet.

292
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,070
You mustn't tell dad about this.

293
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,160
You'll make him worry for nothing.

294
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,350
Where are you going?

295
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,310
Since you are too shy about it,

296
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,790
as your brother,

297
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,400
I should naturally visit my new brother-in-law.

298
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,440
I'll ask him properly

299
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
why he treats you like this.

300
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,440
Why are you so unreasonable?

301
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,510
Since I didn't know about the demonic energy,

302
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,000
Ming Ye must not know it, either.

303
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,270
Now that I knew,

304
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,480
I'll just talk to him.

305
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,270
Why were you so aggressive?

306
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,920
I shouldn't have told you.

307
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,550
I…

308
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,350
I was trying to do you justice!

309
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,750
I pick this path by my self.

310
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,400
I married this man by my decision.

311
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,680
There's no justice to do me.

312
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,480
What's more,

313
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,960
Ming Ye didn't treat me badly.

314
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,480
Instead, he taught me swordsmanship and archery.

315
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,680
I've made great progress.

316
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,030
Swordsmanship and archery?

317
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,480
You won't understand anyway.

318
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
It's getting late.

319
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,750
Ming Ye's probably on his way home.

320
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm gonna go back to Shangqing

321
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
and talk to him about dual-cultivation.

322
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,590
You…

323
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,350
You're just gonna talk to him about it directly?

324
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,640
Otherwise?

325
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,400
Alright.

326
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,550
Then go ahead.

327
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,310
Whatever trouble you have,

328
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,510
remember to come back, back to Mohe.

329
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,750
I don't care who's right or wrong,

330
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,790
I'll always be by your side.

331
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
Why aren't you practicing?

332
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,960
Are you willing to try dual-cultivation with me?

333
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,480
What?

334
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,720
My demonic energy is devouring me.

335
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,070
I heard dual-cultivation can neutralize

336
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,640
foul energy with clear energy.

337
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,070
If you mind it,

338
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,070
I'll think of another way.

339
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,550
You do have a lot of foul energy inside.

340
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,070
It's my fault not to realize it sooner.

341
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,400
This place is clear and cool.

342
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,070
It's perfect for dual-cultivation.

343
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,640
Sang Jiu,

344
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,550
close your eyes.

345
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,400
Breathe in and out with me.

346
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,400
So this is dual-cultivation, huh?

347
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,400
Why was Sang You so mysterious about it?

348
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,270
I thought it's gonna be quite embarrassing.

349
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,110
Sang Jiu.

350
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,270
Get closer to me.

351
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,030
Sang Jiu.

352
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,400
Sang Jiu.

353
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,880
The Healing Barrier

354
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,510
cost quite a lot of treasures.

355
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,400
Goddess Tian Huan?

356
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,110
Great. I'm gonna tell Lord Immortal.

357
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,160
Don't bother.

358
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,750
I'll go tell him myself

359
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,550
and thank him for healing me.

360
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,480
But Goddess…

361
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,720
What?

362
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,480
I'm afraid you can't go now.

363
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,000
Lord Immortal is

364
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,240
doing co-cultivation with his wife.

365
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,200
Wife?

366
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,750
Ming Ye isn't married yet.

367
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,680
What wife?

368
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,240
Goddess Tian Huan… Goddess…

369
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,240
Goddess Tian Huan.

370
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,680
I feel much better now.

371
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,680
This is for you.

372
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,720
Thanks for today.

373
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,750
I'm going to sleep.

374
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,200
Sang Jiu.

375
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,070
Anytime you have a negative energy problem,

376
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,880
come to me.

377
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,240
I will.

378
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,720
Good night.

379
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,310
So,

380
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,440
that clam woman married you,

381
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,960
right?

382
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,720
Sang Jiu married me

383
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,830
three months ago.

384
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,000
At that time,

385
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,680
you were still in a coma.

386
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,110
So, my coma was just in time.

387
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,790
Three months ago, it was me who went to war with you.

388
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,310
It was me

389
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,920
who took a walk with you here in Yuqing Palace.

390
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,880
It was also me

391
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,310
who dug out the Ancient Crystal for you!

392
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,480
You got the Ancient Crystal

393
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
from the Water-calming Stone?

394
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,590
Yes, but so what?

395
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,240
You were dying.

396
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,110
I had to save your life!

397
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,480
If I had known this,

398
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,680
I wouldn't have saved you that desperately.

399
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,960
Then I wouldn't lose everything

400
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,590
or live under someone else's roof now.

401
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,750
You grew up here.

402
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,880
It's not someone else's roof.

403
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,440
Then tell me, Ming Ye.

404
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,200
You and that woman

405
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,790
stay here every day,

406
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,680
loving each other.

407
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,590
What am I?

408
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,640
A maid for your wife?

409
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,240
Tian Huan,

410
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,200
no one takes you as a maid.

411
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,160
If you really feel bad,

412
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
I can leave with Sang Jiu

413
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
and we'll live somewhere else.

414
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,960
Ming Ye,

415
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,200
you're the God of War.

416
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,830
And this is your palace.

417
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,070
You'll leave your own palace for her?

418
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,480
Why don't you stop being the God of War, too?

419
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,000
Enough.

420
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,110
I know you're being too emotional now.

421
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,270
When you calm down tomorrow,

422
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,590
I'll talk to you.

423
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:58,830
Fine.

424
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,110
Very well.

425
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,440
Ming Ye,

426
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,440
that woman is despicable.

427
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,440
She took advantage of your sympathy
and tricked you.

428
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,920
You just can't see that.

429
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,550
How can I make you see her through?

430
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,640
You two

431
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,240
are close to Sang Jiu, right?

432
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,070
Greetings, Goddess.

433
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,070
Lady… Lady Sang

434
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,550
asked us what Lord Immortal loved.

435
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,270
Then, we talked to her.

436
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,110
When Lady Sang first came,

437
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,920
she made every attempt to fawn over Lord Immortal.

438
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,270
But Lord Immortal didn't accept her.

439
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,590
Until…

440
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,550
Continue.

441
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,640
Until one day she saw Lord Immortal

442
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,720
under the Immortal Tree.

443
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,240
Seeing her climb the tree and pick fruit,

444
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,880
Lord Immortal didn't blame her.

445
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,400
Instead…

446
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,110
Instead, he got closer to her.

447
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,070
The Immortal Tree?

448
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,670
Cut the tree down.

449
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,920
-Aye.
-Aye.

450
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,840
Too bad.

451
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,280
So, your name is Sang Jiu?

452
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,070
Goddess Tian Huan?

453
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,550
It's so great to see you're awake.

454
00:34:59,230 --> 00:34:59,800
Yeah.

455
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,880
I finally woke up.

456
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,440
Thank you for taking care of Ming Ye

457
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,550
by the Mohe River.

458
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,360
Or I wouldn't know what to do.

459
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,230
I also want to thank you

460
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,320
for looking after him lately.

461
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,400
I have something to tell you.

462
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,000
I wonder if you're available, Lady Sang.

463
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,590
So, Ming Ye had the tree cut down?

464
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,150
Yes.

465
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,030
For the sake that you married him so young,

466
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,510
I told you secretly.

467
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,800
Don't let anyone else know it.

468
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,510
Thank you.

469
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,110
I heard every day

470
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,440
you put a Hongnai Fruit on his desk.

471
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,710
But haven't you heard about that?

472
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,280
Ming Ye, the God of War,

473
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,280
hates it most when someone gets into his room,

474
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,710
touches his stuff or pesters him.

475
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,280
[Lord Immortal seems to have no preferences.]

476
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,000
[He doesn't like anyone to get close, either.]

477
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,030
I've heard about that.

478
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
But I thought…

479
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,840
Thought what?

480
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,920
You thought you were special?

481
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,190
You thought he liked you?

482
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
Fine, I'll be the nice one

483
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,440
and tell you something more.

484
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,840
That your father forced Ming Ye
to return his kindness

485
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,880
is known to everyone in Shangqing realm.

486
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,400
Ming Ye helps you remove your negative energy

487
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,440
only because he has to,

488
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,760
in case others gossip behind his back.

489
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,480
Besides, Ming Ye used to be an immortal.

490
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,960
Now, he's a demigod

491
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,150
with the pure elixir.

492
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,880
But…

493
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,320
Your negative demonic energy

494
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,070
is terribly harmful to him,

495
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,920
especially to his elixir.

496
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,630
Every day, Ming Ye leads his army
against the Devil's Army,

497
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,670
risking his life.

498
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,710
If your demonic energy hurts him

499
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,280
so that he gets wounded in the battle,

500
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,510
wouldn't you regret it?

501
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,510
I had co-cultivation because I didn't know this.

502
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,360
If I had known my demonic energy was harmful,

503
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,710
I wouldn't have asked for that.

504
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,840
Now, you know.

505
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,190
I won't do that again.

506
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,440
He should have told me.

507
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,230
He's a man and the God of War.

508
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,070
How could he have the nerve to tell you

509
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,510
even the mere co-cultivation with you

510
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,510
would get him into trouble?

511
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,800
Ming Ye led his army out before dawn.

512
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,440
I wonder how he's doing now.

513
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,510
He had co-cultivation only once.

514
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,230
As the God of War,

515
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,670
he can't be that fragile.

516
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,000
You'd better worry about yourself.

517
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,840
Without his help,

518
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,550
if your negative energy pushes back,

519
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,190
what can you do?

520
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,960
I don't know.

521
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,440
I have to think of another way.

522
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,230
Looks like

523
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,630
I have to help you more.

524
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,150
Now that I disturbed your co-cultivation,

525
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,510
I should find a solution for you.

526
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,480
Huan, you have a solution?

527
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,760
When your demonic power accumulates,

528
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,440
don't bother Ming Ye.

529
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,510
Come to me.

530
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,480
Thank you, Huan.

531
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,320
[Ming Ye was unhappy.]

532
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,360
[But why didn't he tell me?]

533
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,400
[Why did he vent his anger on you?]

534
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,070
Ming Ye.

535
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,670
Ming Ye.

536
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,070
Thank you.

537
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,110
Leave it there.

538
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,480
[This is for you.]

539
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,400
[Thanks for today.]

540
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,760
[Today is the day for co-cultivation.]

541
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,800
[Yesterday, Sang Jiu should have
come for co-cultivation.]

542
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,710
[ waited the whole day but she didn't come.]

543
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,670
[I wonder if she was in trouble.]

544
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,440
Did your wife elope with someone else?

545
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,320
What?

546
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,550
Then why have you pulled a long face,

547
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,800
as if you wanted to bite people?

548
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,440
Sang Jiu is a girl.

549
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,360
If you ask her directly,

550
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
she'll be shy.

551
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
[We haven't done co-cultivation for days.]

552
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
[Her negative energy must have accumulated.]

553
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,880
[She's supposed to come to me.]

554
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,960
[I must get this straight to her.]

555
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,550
[The pushing back of demonic energy is serious.]

556
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,880
[We agreed to do co-cultivation every three days.]

557
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,840
[It can't be delayed like this.]

558
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,880
[What a beautiful night!]

559
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,000
[Sang Jiu likes stars.]

560
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,280
[I'll collect some starlight

561
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,840
and give it to her.]

562
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,480
[Hope she'll like it.]

563
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,030
Goddess Tian Huan,

564
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,150
I…

565
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,920
Your demonic energy is pushing back, huh?

566
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,150
You don't need to tell me.

567
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,440
I smelt that from far afar.

568
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,400
Don't worry.

569
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,110
Come with me.

570
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,670
Don't disturb anyone else.

571
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,400
This is the Refining Spring.

572
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,110
Your demonic energy will be cleaned
when you bathe in it.

573
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,320
Quite a lot of treasures in this realm.

574
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,840
But this is a place for immortals.

575
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,800
Why is there a spring
for the cleaning of demonic energy?

576
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,840
This realm is for immortals.

577
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,030
But over thousands of years,

578
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,960
a few demons have come occasionally.

579
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,550
The Spring is natural.

580
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,030
Who knows why it is here?

581
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,920
The water temperature is perfect.

582
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,480
Come have a try.

583
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,760
Jiu, what's wrong?

584
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,920
It… It hurts a lot.

585
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,590
No. It feels good.

586
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,710
If I weren't so busy,

587
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,510
I would like to bathe in it with you.

588
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,230
Oh, I know.

589
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,630
The Spring is for cleaning your demonic energy.

590
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,630
Your vigorous energy makes you feel the pain.

591
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,880
But it works very well.

592
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,480
Look, your skin bathed in the water

593
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,760
has recovered, right?

594
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,710
Yes, indeed.

595
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,960
Get down there.

596
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,280
Jiu,

597
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,150
it won't work well unless you bathe for a long time.

598
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:19,760
I can't hold on.

599
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:22,760
It hurts too much.

600
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:28,840
As if my body were burning.

601
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,230
Jiu,

602
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,480
before you suffer enough,

603
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,630
you can't get what you want.

604
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,960
I heard you wanted to join Ming Ye's army.

605
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,760
How could you
before your demonic energy is eliminated?

606
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,230
I wouldn't deceive you.

607
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,550
Bathe in the Spring for a quarter

608
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,190
and then you can leave.

609
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,590
You'll be refreshed

610
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:06,920
with no more negative energy.

611
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,280
I've got something else to do.

612
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,880
I have to go.

613
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:14,710
By the way,

614
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,400
when Ming Ye knows your demonic energy pushes back,

615
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:18,320
he'll ask how you handle it.

616
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,710
You can tell him

617
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,110
someone else helped you out.

618
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,320
But don't tell him I was the one.

619
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,670
Ming Ye hates it when those around him get too close.

620
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:32,960
I get it.

621
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,230
Don't worry.

622
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,000
It really works.

623
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,230
Give it to me.

624
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,150
No one knew it, huh?

625
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,630
Don't worry, Goddess.

626
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,710
I've killed that man from Yiyue tribe.

627
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,760
No one else knew where his water was.

628
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,510
For so little water,

629
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,000
I did quite a lot.

630
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,360
Anyone, no matter what he is,

631
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,280
can't resist the burning of the water.

632
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,400
Once he touches it,

633
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,480
his energy

634
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,110
will be gone.

635
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,480
Sadly, I could only apply some in the Spring

636
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,760
and it wouldn't kill you.

637
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:50,230
You…

638
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,440
What's up?

639
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,000
Ming Ye,

640
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,550
are you waiting for someone?

641
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,920
For your wife?

642
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,190
If you're here for the scenery

643
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,480
because you have nothing else to do, fine.

644
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,960
But if you're waiting for her to do co-cultivation,

645
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,960
let me remind you.

646
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,550
She doesn't need you anymore.

647
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,000
What's your point?

648
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,510
Haven't you realized that?

649
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,070
Lately, Sang Jiu has been terribly cool to you.

650
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,000
Today, she should have come for co-cultivation.

651
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:31,840
But she's nowhere to be seen.

652
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,030
Even I can tell

653
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:36,630
she's avoiding you.

654
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,670
Why?

655
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,230
Because you were married by force.

656
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,800
It's understandable that you don't love each other.

657
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,480
But don't blame her.

658
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,190
I heard someone else
helped her with co-cultivation.

659
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,030
So,

660
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,590
she probably doesn't need you anymore.

661
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,230
How do you know?

662
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,920
Calm down.

663
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,630
Her demonic energy has increased lately.

664
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,070
You also felt that, right?

665
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,320
Today, she should have had co-cultivation with you.

666
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,480
But she didn't come.

667
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,280
If you don't believe me,

668
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,710
ask her when she's back.

669
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,190
Ye,

670
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,630
you can't force her.

671
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,670
But if you insist,

672
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,190
I'll help you persuade her.

673
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,760
As a woman,

674
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,190
I can talk better with her, anyway.

675
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,630
No need.

676
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,000
All right.

677
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,070
Then, enjoy your time waiting.

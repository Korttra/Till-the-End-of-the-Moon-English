175
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,270
Come with us.

176
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,030
The Demon Realm is your home.

177
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,480
After becoming the Devil God,

178
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,080
you'll know

179
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,240
what real power is.

180
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,030
I don't need

181
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,600
that kind of power.

182
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,030
You don't need it?

183
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,750
I forgot you're not the Devil God yet.

184
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,630
You have no idea

185
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
that your immortal sect lover

186
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,390
was almost devoured by us last night.

187
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,870
Without the Devil God's power,

188
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,270
you're just like them.

189
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,360
Tiny ants others can trample upon at will.

190
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,480
Are you going to make us kill her

191
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,720
before you regret

192
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,750
not accepting the power
of the Devil God sooner?

193
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,870
Give me the Shadow Pearl.

194
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,910
This look in your eyes

195
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,270
is kinda like him.

196
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,080
You came

197
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,510
just to tell me this?

198
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,390
Cang Jiumin.

199
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,630
There are only two paths before you.

200
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,030
If you're willing
to leave the immortal sect

201
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,360
and return to the Demon Realm,

202
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,840
we'll honor you as our lord

203
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,080
and pledge loyalty to you.

204
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,120
If you insist on staying
in the immortal sect,

205
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,240
your devil origin will expose
sooner or later,

206
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,270
By then,

207
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,150
you'll be on the chopping block,

208
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,390
subjected to their punishment.

209
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
Pledging loyalty to me?

210
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,640
Okay.

211
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,240
Since you want to regard me as your lord,

212
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,030
show me your sincerity.

213
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,960
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,000
Kneel down.

215
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,680
It seems that

216
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,160
you don't really want me to be your lord.

217
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,030
After you return to the Demon Realm,

218
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,270
we'll naturally pledge loyalty ot you.

219
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,070
Really?

220
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,720
Just you wait patiently.

221
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,440
My lord, please come back
to the Barren Abyss with us.

222
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,310
Cang Jiumin, how dare you.

223
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,030
You're meeting demons in secret.

224
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,550
Stay put.

225
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,110
I'm going to catch him red-handed today.

226
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,720
I'll make my own decision

227
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,310
which path to take.

228
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,640
I appreciate your intention.

229
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,160
You may go now.

230
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,550
When the time comes,

231
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,640
I'll go to the Barren Abyss myself.

232
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,270
When the time comes?

233
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,830
When will it be?

234
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,680
Are you questioning me?

235
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,030
Did he pop out of nowhere?

236
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,960
Is it some kind of magic?

237
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,350
He suddenly appeared.

238
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,920
Out of the way.

239
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,400
Move.

240
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,680
Cang Jiumin,

241
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,270
I've got you.

242
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,070
If I tell the immortal sects

243
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,680
what happened today,

244
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,510
not only will you be ruined,

245
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,350
but you'll also be taken
to the Demon-subduing Platform

246
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,830
and beaten until your soul disperses.

247
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,680
What a useless Xiaoyao sect genius.

248
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Be my dog.

249
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,880
Maybe I'll spare your worthless life.

250
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,240
Go away!

251
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,640
Murder!

252
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,960
Murder! Run! Run!

253
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Run!

254
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,830
Go away now!

255
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,110
Go back to report it.

256
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,510
Go now.

257
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm helping you.

258
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,640
If I don't kill them,

259
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,830
you'll be the one to die.

260
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,720
You're pushing your luck,

261
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,680
forcing me to deal with you the hard way.

262
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,510
Chief Cen,

263
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,830
thank you for sealing

264
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,030
the Bone-refining Seal.

265
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,200
This is Mi's magic weapon.

266
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,030
Why is it here?

267
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,160
Chief!

268
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,350
Bad news!

269
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
Young Chief was killed by Cang Jiumin!

270
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,830
Run! Run!

271
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,480
[Speed up the formation.]

272
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,350
[Dodge the devil sound.]

273
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,270
This immortal is protecting us!

274
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,790
Quickly hide behind the formation!

275
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,790
Stop.

276
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,240
Cang Jiumin,

277
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,480
do you really want to watch them die?

278
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,440
Si Ying.

279
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,680
My child.

280
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,240
Stop it.

281
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,610
Let go of her.

282
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:19,920
What do you want?

283
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,160
We can talk it out.

284
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,130
What?

285
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,370
You want to talk now?

286
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,000
It's too late.

287
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,850
My child.

288
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,810
Give it up.

289
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,440
My child.

290
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,610
You won't be able to stop us

291
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,890
with your cultivation prowess

292
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,760
and the speed of you wielding the sword.

293
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,920
The immortal sect disciple Cang Jiumin

294
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,330
whom you long to be

295
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,920
won't be able to save her.

296
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,130
Mother!

297
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,920
Besides,

298
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,240
she's not the only one
you need to save today.

299
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,370
Please let go of my child.

300
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,760
Now,

301
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,850
do you still think

302
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,890
you don't need that power?

303
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,850
Help!

304
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,810
On the count of three,

305
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,650
these people will all die.

306
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,530
Can you continue to be Cang Jiumin

307
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,370
with peace of mind

308
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,760

after we instilled
our thousands of years of power into him.

393

Did we make a mistake?

394

Even if we did,

395

would His Lordship's Bone-refining Seal

But

398
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,810
so many mortals have died.

into big trouble.

Let's go.

403
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,160
It was a sunny day.

404
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,480
But the minute we set foot on
Demon Subduing Peak, dark clouds gather.

405
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,570
That you don't know.

406
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,960
Demon Subduing Peak
gets a lot of thunders all year round.

407
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Look, that Demon-subduing Pillar

408
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,400
will direct thunder to the offender.

409
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,000
What crime did Cang Jiumin commit?

410
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,650
It's such a big fuss.

411
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,760
I heard he colluded with demons
to slaughter mortal people

412
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,530
and killed Chief Cen's son.

413
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,050
As an immortal sect disciple,
isn't it a heinous crime

414
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,810
to collude with demons?

415
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,530
Isn't Cang Jiumin

416
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,890
Immortal Zhaoyou's favorite disciple?

417
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,760
Does Chief Zhaoyou have something

418
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,920
to do with it?

419
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,530
I don't think so.

420
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,720
I heard from the seniors of Xiaoyao Sect

421
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,090
that Brother Cang is an upright person.

422
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,960
Perhaps it's a misunderstanding.

423
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,240
Maybe.

424
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah.

425
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,290

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,050
I just want to ask you.

429
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,760
Did you do it?

430
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,720
No.

431
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,760
Okay.

432
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,000
I trust you.

433
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,960
Chief Cen loses his son in his old age.

434
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,720
He is devastated.

435
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,330
He wants to convict and punish you.

436
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,720
I'm afraid he won't spare you.

437
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,760
Master,

438
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,890
I've caused trouble to Xiaoyao Sect.

439
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,370
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,000
There's justice in the world.

441
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,000
I believe

442
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
truth will speak for itself.

443
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,680
Master.

444
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,370
How is Susu?

445
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,890
[She's attacked
by a large amount of evil energy.]

446
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,760
[She hasn't woken up.]

447
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,570
Susu has pure spirit body.

448
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,890
Why is there so much evil energy
accumulating in her body?

449
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,400
Lady Susu is unconscious.

450
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,720
And Chief has been summoned
to Xiaoyao Sect.

451
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,200
Master,

452
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,000
what should we do?

453
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,200
She is fine for now.

454
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,480
But the evil energy in her body
can't be expelled.

455
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,440
I don't know when she'll come round.

456
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,610
Those stupid Taoists.

457
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,720
As expected, they started blaming him

458
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,920
without investigating the truth.

459
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,680
He brought it upon himself.

460
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,960
Had he minded his own business
at the Water-splashing Festival,

461
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,200
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

462
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,650
Cang Jiumin,

463
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,200
you killed my son in Capital of Jing,

injured my disciples,

465
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,440
and hurt innocent people.

466
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,160
Do you admit to your crimes?

467
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,240
I didn't kill him.

468
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,610
The murderers are Chixiao Sect disciples,

469
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,370
demoness Si Ying,

470
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,680
and the evil cultivator, Jing Mie.

471
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,810
Cang Jiumin is determined
to be an immortal sect disciple,

472
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,000
We should just let him suffer

473
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,850
so he'll know that

474
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,960
he's taken a wrong path.

475

You unrepentant lad.

What's done is done,
yet you're still arguing.

477
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,890
This is the proof.

478

[not only will you be ruined tomorrow,]

[and beaten until your soul disperses.]

[Go away!]

It's really Jiumin.

499
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,880
He killed Young Chief.

500
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,650
It's him.

501
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,530
He colluded with demons

502
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,610
and killed his fellow disciple.

503

00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,130
Is that really Jiumin

in the Shadow Pearl?

506
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,320
I feel so bad for Young Chief.

507
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,930
We can't let go of the culprit.

508

Did you all see it?

509

If my son hadn't exposed him today,

510
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,720
I'm afraid the immortal sects

511
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,360
would've been in the dark,

512
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,050
unaware that Xiaoyao Sect

513
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,840
is harboring a demon.

514
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,970
In the Immortal Sect Competition,

515
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,280
I thought it was strange that

516
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,280
the two demons were able
to sabotage our plan

517
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,720
which was only revealed
to the Chiefs of different sects.

518
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,360
It turns out that
there's a mole in the immortal sects.

519
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,280
Chief Cen,

520
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,970
before the truth is uncovered,

521
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,050
How could you assert

522
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,650
my disciple is a devil?

523
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,090
Jiumin.

524
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,610
Don't let this bother you.

525
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,760
What was happening

526
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
at that time?

527
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,090
At that time,

528
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,410
[Si Ying and Jing Mie stopped me in the city.]

529
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,610
[They wanted me as their leader.]

530
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,200
[I rejected them.]

531
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
Nonsense.

532
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,450
The two devils are second to none
in the Demon Realm.

533
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,200
Why would they degrade themselves

534
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,410
to take you, a beginner,

535
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,010
as their leader?

536
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,680
Does anyone believe it?

537
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:53,970
No…

538
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,840
Does anyone believe it?

539
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,610
I don't believe.

540
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,530
It's impossible.

541
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,930
Who would believe it?

542
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,930
We don't.

543
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,930
We don't believe it.

544
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,970
If the immortal sect
wouldn't tolerate him,

545
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,970
we can take him back to Barren Abyss.

546
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,360
Look at this!

547
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,240
the god of heaven is
getting justice for me!

548
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,280
Cang Jiumin.

549
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,410
Today,

550
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,880
I'll make you pay with your life
for my son's death.

551
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,490
Stop.

552
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,720
We're interrogating him today,

553
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,720
not punishing him.

554
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,530
Don't be so domineering.

555
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,450
Chief Qu.

556
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,490
Your daughter is injured by the bastard

557
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,840
and is still at stake.

558
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,680
How could you speak for him?

559
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Of course, I'm heartbroken for her injury.

560
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,930
But today we need to find out the truth

561
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,200
and then make the punishment

562
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,800
fit his crime.

563
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,840
It might be a long time before Susu wakes up.

564
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,720
We can't just wait, doing nothing.

565
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,840
I'm here to take care of Susu.

566
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
You go to Demon Subduing Peak
to see what the situation is.

567
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,360
Yes.

568
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,650
Yue Ya.

569
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,530
Why did that happen?

570
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,930
I heard about an attack
by a devil weapon in Capital of Jing.

571
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,130
They caught Cang Jiumin

572
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,800
and is punishing him
on Demon Subduing Peak.

573
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,240
Demon Subduing Peak.

574
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:37,530
[It's bad.]

575
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,160
[My Lord's identity has been known.]

576
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,610
We've witnessed

577
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,320
him doing the crime.

578
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,880
What do we need to investigate for?

579
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,450
Seeing is not believing.

580
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,880
There are only traces of his shadow
in Shadow Pearl.

581
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,320
We don't know the whole story.

582
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,280
There were many citizens present.

583
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,880
We can find them and ask them about it.

584
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,320
We'll see if the truth is as Chief Cen thinks.

585
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,650
That's right.

586
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,490
We can't be so arbitrary.

587
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,450
It's a matter of life and death.

588
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,530
We have to be careful.

589
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,130
Yeah.

590
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,840
I feel sorry for your loss of your son.

591
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,050
But you can't

592
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,530
convict my disciple of death,
based on this evidence.

593
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,680
It's a vain hope.

594
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,360
You…

595
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,650
[Sorry, my lord.]

596
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,130
[I didn't expect to get you into this.]

597
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,240
Who may you be?

598
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,320
It's bad.

599
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,050
Di Mian has come.

600
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,650
This old bastard

601
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,970
might have known the devil fetus is here.

602
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,800
What do we do?

603
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,840
Should we get him back?

604
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,410
You and I have not yet
recovered our energy.

605
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,160
They're too many

606
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,050
for us to fight.

607
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,240
Let's wait.

608
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,760
Chief Qu.

609
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,010
[Why did he come?]

610
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,160
Chief Qu.

611
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,410
It has been years.

612
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,010
How have you been?

613
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,610
Thank you for your concern.

614
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,930
I'm fine.

615
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:55,970
Everyone.

616
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,200
This is Lord of Evil
who helped to destroy Devil God

617
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,050
and made great contributions
thousands of years ago,

618
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,050
Di Mian.

619
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,930
When I was injured
and fell into Barren Abyss,

620
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,450
he saved me.

621
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,490
Lord of Evil is actually still alive.

622
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,930
After Devil God was destroyed,

623
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,530
I had been sealed in the Barren Abyss

624
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,760
and been tortured.

625
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,240
The barrier has loosened recently,

626
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,930
so I got away

627
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,090
with all my strength.

628
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,050
What can we do for you?

629
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,240
Lord of Evil.

630
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,650
I had gone wrong before,

631
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,840
having followed Devil God for many years.

632
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,410
As a result, I lost my wife.

633
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,800
Since then,

634
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,570
I swear to be sworn against Devil God.

635
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,610
I came here

636
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,680
to prevent Devil God from being reborn

637
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,880
and bringing disasters.

638
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:53,930
Boy.

639
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,200
Your identity as the devil fetus

640
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,720
has finally been known.

641
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,410
What?

642
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,450
Did I hear that right?

643
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,610
How can it be?

644
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,800
The devil fetus?

645
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,360
Cang Jiumin is the devil fetus!

646
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,530
No wonder the two devils
want him as their leader.

647
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,280
Yeah.

648
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,280
How can it be?

649
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,530
It makes sense now.

650
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,680
He's actually the devil fetus.

651
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,840
I'm not.

652
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,530
I'm not.

653
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,930
Of course, you're not Devil God,

654
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,720
because Devil God has died.

655
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,490
You shouldn't be alive.

656
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,490
Only if you're dead,

657
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,880
Devil God will never be reborn,

658
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,840
and all disasters will come to an end.

659
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,840
I found the firm evidence
that you're the devil fetus.

660
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,050
Just as I thought,

661
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,010
everyone,

662
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,130
God-slaughtering Crossbow

663
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,530
is on him.

664
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,240
What?

665
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,200
God-slaughtering Crossbow has showed up!

666
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,130
God-slaughtering Crossbow!

667
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,280
It's a devil weapon that didn't appeared
in the past ten thousand years.

668
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,160
God-slaughtering Crossbow!

669
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,160
Why is he keeping the weapon of Devil God?

670
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,320
It's really unexpected.

671
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,240
Who's he on earth?

672
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,880
God-slaughtering Crossbow!

673
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
I detected it!

674
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,800
It's God-slaughtering Crossbow!

675
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,320
God-slaughtering Crossbow is on him!

676
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,240
Jiumin.

677
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,490
This is no trivial matter.

678
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,360
You need to be honest

679
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,490
Don't be forced a confession.

680
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,680
Master.

681
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,010
God-slaughtering Crossbow

682
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,410
is on me indeed.

683
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,200
How come God-slaughtering Crossbow is on Jiumin?

684
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,360
He admitted it himself.

685
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,800
This is awful.

686
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,720
Is he really…?

687
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,970
Whether he's guilty or not,

688
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,010
dispose of him before he becomes

689
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:49,840
a real problem.

690
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,650
Yes.

691
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,650
Kill him…

692
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,200
I won't become Devil God.

693
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,680
I didn't kill anyone
with God-slaughtering Crossbow.

694
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,050
I didn't kill anyone.

695
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,160
Devil God still exists.

696
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,490
Devil God won't be dead forever

697
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,650
unless all the lives are killed and

698
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,360
hatred and bitterness disappeared.

699
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,010
[Ruo Water is where
all the primordial spirits return to.]

700
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,570
[That's why Devil God picked Yiyue Tribe.]

701
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,530
He made a contract with them

702
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,160
and gave them the responsibility
of bearing and raising the demon fetus.

703
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,800
You

704
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,410
tell us.

705
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,240
What's your relationship
with the Yiyue Tribe?

706
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,010
Yiyue Tribe

707
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,570
is my home tribe.

708
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,450
What?

709
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,010
What?

710
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,200
He admitted it!

711
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,050
It's really terrifying.

712
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:00,680
Right.

713
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,320
How are you to explain yourself now?

714
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,360
I don't care whether Devil God
made a contract with Yiyue Tribe.

715
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,360
Whatever my destiny is,

716
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,720
I'll choose to be

717
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,450
righteous or evil on my own.

718
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:16,760
I

719
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,360
will never become Devil God.

720
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,280
Won't you?

721
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,970
Let me tell you another secret.

722
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,450
On the day when Devil God

723
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,010
made the contract with Yiyue Tribe…

724
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,490
Lord.

725
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,490
If that day has come,

726
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,880
how can we identify the devil fetus?

727
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,410
Evil Bone is a secret

728
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,450
and not easy to be detected.

729
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,720
[My fetus]

730
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,570
[will surely be out of the ordinary.]

731
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,240
[I heard the mortal people like
to make up stories.]

732
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,490
[I'd like to learn from them]

733
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,590
[and make up his fate.]

734
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:55,950
[Jin.]

735
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,650
[He'll kill his mother before birth.]

736
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,650
[He grows in an imperial palace]

737
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,530
[but is left out and be bullied.]

738
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,570
He's a monster.

739
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,010
Bark, like a dog.

740
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,490
Bark…

741
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,450
Coward.

742
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,760
You don't dare to resist.

743
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,410
Beat him.

744
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,530
Even a dog can bite and fight.

745
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,570
You good-for-nothing.

746
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,840
[He'll be a king.]

747
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,050
Your Majesty.

748
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,800
[and be on top of everything.]

749
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,090
[When he's riding high]

750
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,090
[and experience the world,]

751
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,130
[he'll hit the bottom]

752
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,680
[and face betrayal and resentment.]

753
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,130
[Although he has ascended to the throne]

754
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,570
[and expanded the territory,]

755
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,760
[he'll face a fratricidal struggle]

756
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,360
[and his wife turning on him.]

757
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,760
[He'll taste all bitterness.]

758
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,930
[Tantai Jin.]

759
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,970
Kill me now.

760
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,090
[I'll curse you and laugh at you]

761
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,840
every day.

762
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,760
Ye Xiwu!

763
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,410
Kill me!

764
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:05,650
No.

765
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,450
Stop saying that…

766
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,200
[They're the closest people in your life.]

767
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,760
[Whatever he does,]

768
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,130
[it'll be in vain.]

769
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,010
[All beautiful things]

770
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,570
[in his life are illusions.]

771

[What he loves or pursues for]

772
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,240
[will disappear.]

773
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,650
[Suffering is the truth for him.]

774
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,240
Ye Xiwu.

775
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,650
Speak!

776
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,410
[He'll lose everything.]

777
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:34,930
[It's not enough.]

778
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,930
[He'll join an immortal sect.]

779
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,610
[He thinks he has taken a right road.]

780
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,760
[He feels the warmth
from his master and fellows]

781
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,720
[but he'll find it's an illusion.]

782
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,800
[In the end,]

783
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,760
[he'll kill his master
and become a devil.]

784
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,240
[What do you]

785
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,090
[think of]

786
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,840
[the story? Di Mian.]

787
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:17,880
No.

788
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,490
Tantai Jin.

789
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,160
Are you still

790
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,650
insisting you're not the devil fetus?

791
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,450
It turns out

792
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,840
all that I've suffered

793
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,760
has been arranged.

794
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:51,800
Everyone.

795
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,160
He doesn't deny it.

796
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,650
We can conclude

797
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,280
that what I've told

798
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,570
is true.

799
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,840
Do you want to see him

800
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,410
kill his master and become a devil

801
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,200
and to regret later?

802
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,970
Whether it's true or not,

803
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,090
he must die if he's a devil.

804
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,090
Yes, he must die!

805
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:09,650
We must kill him.

806
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,010
Will he really bring a terminal disaster

807
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,280
as predicted?

808
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,490
I can't believe

809
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:14,680
the devil fetus has been

810
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,760
around us.

811
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:16,760
There are inarguable proofs.

[Taintai Jin.]

813

00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,570
[Suspicion.]

815

[Fear.]

[Hatred.]

[Disappointment.]

[Are you feeling cold?]

819

[The coldness extended to your fingertips.]

[Do you find it hard to explain?]

[I made you experience in mortal world]

822

[and made you learn to love]

[just for today,]

[because I want you
to better experience all of this.]

825
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,610
The thunder is booming more frequently.

826
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,880
Is the thunder
attracted by the demon fetus?

827
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:55,320
It's the will of Heaven.

828
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,410
It's the will of Heaven!

if it'll let go of you, the devil fetus.

835

Come here.

836
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,530

[really care who you are?]

Are you still protecting your disciple?

858
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,130
Kill him!

859
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,760
Kill him and save the three realms.

860
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,360
This is a winning trade.

861
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:33,680
Trade?

862
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,240

-I can't do this.
-Yeah.

867

The evidence is certain.

What are you hesitating about?

870
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,650
The fact is a fact,

871

but you're still protecting the devil fetus.

872

You have nothing to say now, don't you?

887
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,720
You've witnessed this.

888
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,840
Cang Jiumin is the devil fetus.

889
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,800
Kill him…

890
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,610
Don't let go of the devil fetus.

891

Kill him.
